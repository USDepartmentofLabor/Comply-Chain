                    Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade unions,
                    sustainable and responsible investor (SRI) bodies and other
                    civil society groups conduct investigations, publicize
                    problems and raise awareness about corporate conduct. Some
                    seek to educate consumers about labor issues or launch
                    boycotts and other campaigns to stop egregious abuses. Some
                    approach companies directly to discuss and address labor
                    concerns and do not disclose their findings publicly unless
                    the companies choose not to take meaningful action.
