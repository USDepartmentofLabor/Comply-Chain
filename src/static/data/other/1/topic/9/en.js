                    For some companies, having a social compliance system is
                    intrinsically &ldquo;the right thing to do.&rdquo; Such companies are more likely to devote significant support and 
                    resources to their social compliance systems, often in parallel with community-based programming, which have an overall 
                    benefit for the communities in which they operate.

                        impacting their business including human rights and workplace conditions. Coca-Cola works towards this 
                        priority through a Human Rights Policy, auditing thousands of suppliers to validate compliance, and engaging 
                        third parties to evaluate labor rights risks, such as risks present in the sugar supply chain. Coca-Cola 
                        notes that investing in social compliance, such as ensuring inclusivity in the workplace, is &ldquo;both the right 
                        thing to do and a strategic business priority&rdquo;. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To that end, their sustainability initiatives include both compliance and social programs that address structural 
                        inequalities, including programs that address barriers that women face around the world. In 2010, Coca-Cola announced their 
                        &ldquo;5by20&rdquo; global initiative at the UN Headquarters in New York City. This initiative aimed to facilitate the 
                        economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs across their supply chains by 2020. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coca-Cola worked directly with the UN and ensured their efforts aligned with the UN&rsquo;s Millennium Development Goals 
                        and the Women&rsquo;s Empowerment Principles. Over the next 10 years, Coca-Cola worked on increasing access to economic 
                        opportunities for women, breaking down barriers women experience in the workplace, and empowering women through professional 
                        development courses. At the end of the 10-year initiative, Coca-Cola not only met their target of five million women 
                        entrepreneurs but surpassed it. Their achievements included providing 4,842,777 million women with business skills training, 
                        1,767,796 million women with networking or mentoring opportunities, and 1,690,581 million women with access to finance or assets.

                    <p>
                        Summarizing these accomplishments, Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO James Quincy said, “By investing in women&rsquo;s economic 
                        empowerment over the past decade, we have created shared value in hopes of a better shared future—enabling improved livelihoods 
                        for women, their families, and their communities.”

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Hindustan Unilever&rsquo;s operations are primarily based in India, where millions of people face extreme levels of rural poverty. 
                            As part of its social compliance system, Hindustan Unilever made a conscious effort to ensure that all workers within their operations, 
                            from the factory floor to office workers, received wages that were well above the statutory minimum. Such efforts are integrated into 
                            Unilever&rsquo;s Responsible Sourcing Policy, which aims to make &ldquo;a positive social impact on the lives of millions of people in our 
                            supply chains around the world.&rdquo; Their approach is to ensure implementation of mandatory requirements among their suppliers while also 
                            advancing good practices above and beyond minimum requirements. 
                        </p>

                            is one such good practice. Described as a &ldquo;living wage,&rdquo; these wages considered market indicators such as inflation, commodity prices, 
                            gender disparities, and standards of living. This commitment to a living wage ensured that employees would be able to provide not just 
                            for themselves but their families as well. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along with this promise to their employees linked with their social compliance efforts, Hindustan Unilever also sought to empower 
                            female entrepreneurs through Project Shakti, a program that supported rural women in villages across India by cultivating 
                            entrepreneurial skills. Hindustan Unilever provided training to women in rural communities on topics including communication, 
                            negotiation, marketing, distribution management, and accounting. In addition to skills training, all the women who participated 
                            in the training were provided with the opportunity to sell products to small retail outlets in their vicinity in order to help 
                            them establish additional sources of income. As of the end of 2020, Project Shakti trained more than 136,000 women entrepreneurs 
                            across 18 states and plans to extend this project into Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Colombia.
