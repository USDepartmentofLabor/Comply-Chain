                In much of the world, financial institutions must adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) requirements to monitor and identify 
                financial activities that potentially relate to criminal activities. Financial institutions disclose these activities as part 
                of a suspicious transaction report to the respective financial intelligence unit. In the United States, for example, financial 
                institutions and other finance-related entities submit suspicious transaction reports to the{" "}

                , also known as the Burma Business Advisory. USDOL—in collaboration with the Departments of the Treasury, State, Commerce, 
                Homeland Security, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative—released the Burma Business Advisory on January 26, 2022. 
                Following a February 2021 coup, the Burmese military reportedly killed more than 1,400 people, unjustly arrested civilian 
                leaders, and committed widespread grave human rights abuses against the Burmese people. The military regime has targeted the 
                country&rsquo;s labor union movement, outlawing 16 labor unions, attacking striking workers, and arresting many union leaders and 
                members. The military regime has also facilitated corruption, which exposes businesses and individuals involved in operations 
                or supply chains tied to the regime to significant reputational, financial, and legal risks.

                USDOL&rsquo;s international child labor and forced labor reporting highlights more than a dozen goods produced in 
                Burma using child labor, forced labor, and/or forced child labor. Evidence also exists that state-owned enterprises 
                in Burma are significantly involved in industries tied to human trafficking, child and forced labor, and the targeting 
                of labor unions. The Department of State has also coordinated U.S. government business advisories for other countries
