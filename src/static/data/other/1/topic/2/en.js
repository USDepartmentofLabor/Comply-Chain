                    Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, states have the duty to protect against human rights abuse within 
                    their territory or jurisdiction by third parties, including business enterprises. States also have the duty to take appropriate 
                    steps to ensure that when such abuses occur, those affected have access to effective remedy. For their part, business enterprises 
                    have the responsibility to respect human rights, including by avoiding, causing, or contributing to adverse human rights impacts 
                    through their own activities. Corporate actors also have the responsibility to provide victims access to effective remedy and 
                    should prevent or mitigate such impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products, or services by their business 
                    relationships. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights apply to all states and all business enterprises, both 
                    transnational and others, regardless of their size, sector, location, ownership, or structure.

                in global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor of vulnerable groups and minorities and forced labor in the 
                agricultural, solar, and garment sectors.
