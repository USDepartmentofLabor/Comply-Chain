                    Good social compliance systems are based on strong overall
                    management systems. They require planning, documentation,
                    internal controls, training and communication with company
                    employees, sound analysis of data, and other clearly-defined
                    policies and procedures. Implementing a social compliance
                    system requires a company to gain control over complex
                    global supply chains, which can bring additional
                    efficiencies and benefits to its operations.
