                    that develop robust social compliance systems are also more likely to recruit workers fairly and in accordance with 
                    international labor standards across their supply chains. The creation of a strong enabling environment that provides 
                    workers with a collective voice may also make these companies a more attractive choice for prospective employees, 
                    particularly in countries with weaker labor enforcement.

                    <em>Worker engagement:</em> Delayed wage payments, unaddressed grievances, and the hinderance of workers&rsquo; right to collectively 
                    organize can adversely impact employee motivation and contradict fundamental principles and rights at work. Companies 
                    that implement social compliance and corporate sustainability systems report stronger employee motivation, engagement, 
                    and performance.

                        service, and build a diverse and inclusive workforce, has influenced our hiring strategy.  We&rsquo;re also looking for skills
