                        California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (2010)
                    </a>
                    , enacted in the early 2010s to respond to human rights concerns, require certain companies to publicly disclose information about their supply 
                    chains. Since then, there have been more laws passed and regulations promulgated inside and outside the United States that strengthen protections 
                    against child labor and forced labor in supply chains. In addition, a number of countries incorporate various labor provisions into trade 
                    agreements. One recent example is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which has fully enforceable labor standards—including 
                    enforcement of laws regarding forced labor and child labor. USMCA also includes new provisions that require the parties to take measures to 
                    prohibit the importation of goods produced by forced labor, including forced child labor; address violence against workers exercising their labor 
                    rights; address sex-based discrimination in the workplace; and ensure that migrant workers are protected under labor laws.

                                    (Dodd-Frank Act), passed in 2010, directed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue regulations requiring companies 
                                    that manufacture products to report on “conflict minerals” in corporate supply chains under Section 1502. Congress enacted Section 1502 
                                    because of concerns that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals by armed groups helps finance conflict in the Democratic Republic 
                                    of the Congo (DRC) and contributes to an emergency humanitarian crisis in the region. The law requires reporting companies that submit SEC 
                                    filings to disclose annually whether products they manufacture contain tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (together considered &rdquo;conflict minerals&rdquo; 
                                    under the provision) from the DRC or an adjoining country, and, if so, whether the conflict minerals finance or benefit armed groups in and near 
                                    the DRC.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The SEC promulgated a rule requiring companies to determine whether they use such minerals and whether such minerals are necessary to 
                                    the functionality or production of a product they manufacture or contract to have manufactured. If so, the rule requires that companies 
                                    conduct a good faith inquiry into the country of origin of the minerals, and make certain disclosures to the SEC. Under the rule, companies 
                                    are also required to make the information they disclosed to the SEC available on their websites.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        However, the requirement to disclose if products are DRC conflict-free was held by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
                                        in 2014 to be a violation of the First Amendment. As a result, the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Corporation Finance suspended enforcement of this 
                                        disclosure pending further decision by the SEC on this issue.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Presently, companies continue to file required forms with the SEC and conduct origin inquiries.

                                    , which was signed into law in October 2010 and went into effect in January 2012, requires certain companies to report on 
                                    their specific actions to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. The law is aimed at mid-size and 
                                    large retailers and manufacturing companies having worldwide annual revenues of $100 million or more. Its chief goal is to 
                                    ensure companies provide consumers with information that enables consumers to understand which companies manage their supply 
                                    chains responsibly. It is estimated that this reporting requirement could impact about 3,200 companies headquartered in California 
                                    or doing business in the state.

                                    The law requires a company to disclose on its website its initiatives to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its direct 
                                    supply chain for the goods offered for sale. A company must disclose to what extent it: (1) engages in verification of product 
                                    supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery; (2) conducts audits of suppliers; (3) requires 
                                    direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human 
                                    trafficking of the countries in which they are doing business; (4) maintains accountability standards and procedures for employees 
                                    or contractors that fail to meet company standards regarding slavery and human trafficking; and (5) provides employees and management

                                    and Title XVII of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013: Ending Trafficking in Government Contracting. The rule 
                                    strengthens the existing prohibition against trafficking in government contracts by expressly prohibiting federal contractors, 
                                    contractor employees, subcontractors, and subcontractor employees from engaging in specific types of trafficking-related activities. 
                                    Such activities include destroying and confiscating identity documents, using misleading recruitment practices, failing to provide 
                                    return transportation costs upon the end of employment in most situations, failing to provide an employment contract in writing, providing 
                                    housing that fails to meet standards, and charging employees recruitment fees. Contractors are required to take appropriate action against 
                                    employees, agents, and subcontractors who violate the prohibitions, and they must inform their employees of the prohibited activities and 
                                    associated consequences. Additionally, where contracts that exceed $500,000 are performed outside the United States, contractors must 
                                    develop a compliance plan with an employee awareness program, a process for employee reporting of violations, a housing plan, and a wage 
                                    and hour plan. Such contractors must certify annually that they are implementing their plans and that neither they nor their subcontractors 
                                    have engaged in the prohibited practices, or if violations are found in their supply chain, that they have taken appropriate remedial and

                                    disclose the measures they are taking to combat slavery and human trafficking. The law does not specify what 
                                    types of measures companies should disclose nor have any requirements regarding how much detail companies should 
                                    provide. A company may comply by noting in its statement that it has not taken any steps to combat slavery or human 
                                    trafficking. The statement must be published on the company&rsquo;s website in a prominent place. There are no penalties 
                                    for non-compliance. The UK Modern Slavery Act also creates minimum sentences for slavery crimes, introduces a

                                    </a>
                                    , amended on March 28, 2017, requires large corporations with 5,000 or more employees headquartered in France and foreign corporations 
                                    with 10,000 or more employees doing business in France to create and implement a vigilance plan. The plan should identify risks and prevent 
                                    violations of human rights such as child labor, forced labor, and trafficking resulting from the activities of parent companies, subsidiaries, 
                                    and any subcontractors used by the parent company or subsidiaries. Vigilance plans must include: (1) procedures to identify risks; (2) methods 
                                    to regularly monitor subsidiaries and subcontractors; (3) adequate approaches to mitigate risks and prevent serious harm; (4) a method to report 
                                    risks; and (5) a method to monitor the efficacy of preventative measures. Victims or other affected parties may inform the courts of a company&rsquo;s 
                                    failure to have a plan or implement a plan, and the company may be ordered to implement a plan and compensate victims who suffered because of its 
                                    non-compliance as a breach of a duty of care.

                                        , which will enter into force on January 1, 2023. Under the act, companies are obligated to identify and assess human rights and 
                                        environmental risks and to establish an adequate and effective risk management system, including publication of an annual report 
                                        outlining steps to identify and address risks. The risks that companies must address include forced labor, child labor, 
                                        discrimination, violations to freedom of association, unethical employment, unsafe working conditions, and environmental degradation. 
                                        The act applies to companies with their head office, principal place of business, administrative headquarters, domestic branch, or 
                                        registered office in Germany and employing more than 3,000 employees (more than 1,000 employees beginning in 2024). Companies not in

                                    in China&rsquo;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (the &rdquo;XUAR&rdquo;). A key feature of the UFLPA is the creation of a rebuttable presumption that all
