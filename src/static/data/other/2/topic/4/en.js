                <p>
                    Like any successful business unit, the social compliance management team should have management systems that are 
                    integrated into the overall systems of the company, rather than existing in a silo separate from other business operations. 
                    Many management system elements―such as risk assessment, communication plans, information systems, grievance and complaint 
                    mechanisms, and independent verification―are the subject of this app and are covered more comprehensively in different sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Managing any system or program should start with setting goals, objectives, and targets for performance. Many social compliance programs 
                    establish metrics, or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), against which to measure progress. KPIs can be developed internally or as part of 
                    a benchmarking exercise to compare against other companies&rsquo; programs. Once set, the team should periodically check progress against 
                    those targets or indicators and address areas in which they have not been met. The team should also periodically review its processes and 
                    policies and update them as needed. Companies with strong social compliance systems are always in &ldquo;continuous improvement&rdquo; mode.

                    On a practical level, the management team should ensure that it has documented all of the functions of the social compliance system. 
                    This documentation should include written policies and procedures for all components of the system, as well as communication protocols. 
                    It should also include documents for distribution to other units of the company&mdash;for example, a summary of the provisions of supplier 
                    contracts with respect to their social compliance obligations is likely to be very useful for the sourcing department. The team&rsquo;s 
                    documented policies and procedures should have approval and buy-in from senior management.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies and industry associations may choose to incorporate provisions on management systems in their codes of conduct and require compliance 
                    by association members and suppliers. This concept is demonstrated in the example that follows.
