                <h1>The Social Compliance Team</h1>
                    <p>
                        In multinational companies, the social compliance team typically comprises a management team, based at headquarters, and a 
                        field team, based in countries from which products are sourced, while small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) typically have 
                        smaller social compliance teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Corporate structures vary widely, but a social compliance team is often part of a larger corporate social responsibility (CSR) or 
                        sustainability department within the company. The hallmark of the most successful social compliance/CSR teams is that they have a 
                        direct line of communication with high-level decision-makers, including the CEO and Board of Directors. In addition, the social 
                        compliance or CSR function must be well-integrated with other components of the company, particularly in areas such as supply 
                        chain management, product development, quality assurance, sourcing, and procurement. For example, Nike Corporation&rsquo;s social 
                        compliance function sits within its &ldquo;

                            sustainable innovation team
                        </a>
                        ,&rdquo; which is responsible for not only environmental and social compliance but also product development.

                        The social compliance management team oversees the entire social compliance system. It plans activities, monitors 
                        implementation, and receives and analyzes reports from the field. Ideally, the team is also empowered to make 
                        decisions about individual situations and the system as a whole. In addition to possessing core management skills 
                        such as budgeting and data analysis, the management team should also include members who have the flexibility to 
                        deal with unexpected situations, who can motivate and support the field team, and who can advocate on behalf of the 
                        system to senior management. Management team members should also have some field exposure. They should shadow audits, 
                        speak with workers and the labor unions that represent them both at the workplace and outside of it, and experience 
                        for themselves the reality of workplaces from which products are sourced.

                    <p>
                        The social compliance management team should also be positioned for long-term continuity. In companies where social 
                        compliance is segregated from other business functions, the departure of one or two key members of the team can damage 
                        the entire social compliance program. It is important, therefore, that the team build capacity across a spectrum of 
                        staff members, so that operations can survive changes in personnel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, the management team must have adequate resources to do its job. Above all, the allocation of resources from 
                        senior management, as well as performance incentive structures that reward employees for social compliance innovation, 
                        initiative, and impact, are signals that social compliance matters to the company.

                        Compliance field teams consist of the social auditors who carry out social audits in production facilities and work with 
                        factory management to identify appropriate remediation strategies. Learn more about audits, in particular social audits,
