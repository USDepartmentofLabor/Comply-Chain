                <h1>Corrective Action Plans</h1>
                <p>
                    A Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is typically formulated
                    shortly after the audit. Companies handle their development
                    in different ways: some develop CAPs themselves based on
                    audit findings; some require the supplier to draft its own
                    CAP for review/approval by the company; some require the
                    vendor/agency to draft a CAP for its supplier. In some
                    cases, auditors themselves develop the CAP, but this
                    approach raises concerns because it may present a conflict
                    of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is good practice to provide opportunities for worker and
                    community input into a CAP, particularly those workers who
                    were directly affected by violations. This can be done
                    through a workers&rsquo; organization, a civil society
                    organization or directly with individual workers, according
                    to defined procedures.
                </p>
                <p>A CAP should include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All audit findings;</li>
                    <li>
                        The specific action(s) required to remedy each finding,
                        including assistance for individual victims; new written
                        policies or procedures; training for managers, staff,
                        employees; and other actions;
                    </li>
                    <li>Who is responsible for each action;</li>
                    <li>
                        How each action will be verified/confirmed, such as
                        record review, employee interviews, spot-checks or other
                        means;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The deadline or milestones for completing each action,
                        which normally should be as expeditious as possible; and
                    </li>
                    <li>Potential consequences if actions are not taken.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, if workers are found to be in forced labor in a
                    workplace, the CAP may require one or more of the
                    remediation measures in Tables 1-4 under{" "}
                    <em>
                        <u>Preventing Recurrence</u>
                    </em>
                    . It should clearly specify who is responsible for
                    overseeing and following up on each measure. It may require
                    the establishment of new procedures and clarify the lines of
                    responsibility for implementing these procedures. It may
                    establish new &ldquo;check&rdquo; mechanisms to detect
                    forced labor in the workplace, and specify who is
                    responsible for conducting these checks. It may also require
                    a training session for all management on the issue of forced
                    labor and the code of conduct&rsquo;s forced labor
                    requirements. Finally, the CAP may state the actions that
                    the company will take if this violation is repeated, such as
                    temporary suspension of orders or cancellation of future
                    orders.

                    Once a CAP is in place, oversight and follow-up are, of
                    course, critical. Typically the company tracks
                    implementation of the CAP, checking back with the supplier
                    on progress, particularly at the times when milestones were
                    to be reached. If the company has personnel in the
                    geographic location, they can check back directly, the
                    original audit team can return to do a follow-up, or another
                    audit team can do so. The company can also hold its
                    vendors/agents responsible for follow-up. The important
                    point is not who does it, but that it is done in a timely
                    and effective manner and is founded on clear communication
                    with the supplier. As part of CAP implementation, many
                    companies provide ongoing training and capacity building to
                    support the supplier in the process of continuous
                    improvement.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite their clear incentive to maintain a positive
                    business relationship with a company, occasionally suppliers
                    will not engage effectively on CAPs either because they do
                    not have adequate support or training or do not perceive an
                    incentive to do so. Therefore, CAPs should include
                    incentives for suppliers such as a price premium, purchase
                    guarantees, access to financing and/or regular public
                    reporting that rewards compliance. If remediation and
                    engagement efforts have failed to achieve the desired
                    results, you should consider ending your sourcing
                    relationship with this supplier, taking into account the
                    potential impacts on the workers and attempting to mitigate
                    those impacts in the process.
