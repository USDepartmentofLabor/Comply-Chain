                <h1>Improving Victim Situations</h1>
                <p>
                    Audit teams must be prepared to encounter a broad range of situations with respect to child or forced labor in the workplace, from 
                    individualized cases to situations involving systemic and egregious abuse. Prior to the audit, auditors should prepare themselves with 
                    knowledge of local resources, including law enforcement and organizations that provide victim services. Companies that have gathered this 
                    type of data as part of their risk assessments and communications efforts and captured it in their information systems are best equipped 
                    to prepare auditors by providing this information in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a guiding principle, auditors&rsquo; immediate actions and the ongoing corrective actions taken by management should focus on what is best 
                    for the victims in question. Cases of egregious abuse that contravene local law should be reported to local law enforcement authorities, but 
                    this should be done in a manner that ensures the safety and well-being of the victims. Below is general guidance for actions that can be taken 
                    in response to various findings of child labor and forced labor.
                </p>
                <h2>Child Labor</h2>
                <h2>Underage Labor</h2>
                <p>
                    If an audit or other reporting mechanism identifies a child in the workplace who is under the country&rsquo;s legal working age, the child 
                    should be removed from work immediately and referred to social services to ensure their well-being. If the audit identifies a child who is 
                    of legal age to work in the country, the appropriate immediate response depends on the company&rsquo;s code of conduct. If the company has 
                    set a minimum age that is higher than the legal minimum, the child should be removed from work immediately if they are below that age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is critical to keep in mind the possible consequences for the child. The child and the child&rsquo;s family will lose income, 
                    and unless it is replaced, the child may simply find a different job, potentially under worse conditions for the child&rsquo;s health, 
                    safety, or well-being. Companies can take steps to mitigate this situation by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Providing a stipend to the child&rsquo;s family to make up for the lost income, if the child&rsquo;s family can be contacted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Offering the child&rsquo;s job to another member of the family who is of legal age to work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Providing alternative income generation opportunities to the child&rsquo;s parents or adult relatives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensuring that the child attends school or an alternative educational facility, paying associated fees as needed and tracking the child 
                        until they are of age to work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Providing the child with a training or apprenticeship opportunity when they are of legal age for such programs and committing to provide 
                        the job back once they are of full legal working age.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Linking the child to educational, developmental, psychosocial, and other services provided by the government or NGOs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the child has been living away from their family, reuniting the child with the family while ensuring that the family can provide a 
                        protective environment and provide the applicable services.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Hazardous Child Labor</h2>
                <p>
                    No child under age 18 should be involved in the Worst Forms of Child Labor specified in ILO Convention 182 (see{" "}
                    <Link to="/steps/3">Step 3, Develop a Code of Conduct</Link>). If children are found in such situations, the best approaches include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Eliminating any dangerous work activities from the child&rsquo;s job and closely monitoring the child&rsquo;s work activities on an 
                        ongoing basis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Helping the child identify other safe income-earning opportunities, if there is no feasible way to reduce hazards in the current 
                        work environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensuring that the child is not working too many hours or at times that endanger their health, well-being, or education.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finding a way for the child to make up for the lost income through other earning opportunities, a stipend, or family interventions, 
                        in the event working hours are reduced.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Linking the child to educational, developmental, psychosocial, and other services provided by the government or NGOs.

                    These activities are resource-intensive. The relationships you have worked hard to build are vital at this stage, helping you to find resources 
                    and expertise available in the community. Of course, there are communities with very few resources and educational institutions. Options for action 
                    in such cases are discussed in <Link to="/steps/2/topic/9">Addressing Root Causes</Link>.

                    <p>
                        Since 2011, the U.S.-based Fair Labor Association* (FLA) has been assessing working conditions at hazelnut farms in the Black Sea 
                        region of Turkey, first as a special project commissioned by the multinational corporation Nestl&eacute;* and later as a collaboration 
                        between the FLA, Nestl&eacute;, and two of its Turkey-based hazelnut suppliers, Balsu Gida* and Olam Progida.* Annually, the FLA sends 
                        a team of assessors to visit a sample of farms supplying hazelnuts to these companies. The presence of child labor has been a consistent 
                        finding both among local workers&rsquo; families and among the groups of migrant workers who travel to the region for the hazelnut harvest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The companies have pursued several remediation strategies in response to these findings, such as civil society partnerships to build 
                        schools and provide scholarships for children of migrant workers and in hazelnut communities. Further interventions have included 
                        training for farmers on child labor prohibitions and the provision of age-verification tools to encourage farmers to document the 
                        ages of their hired workers.

                        yielded new insights into the seasonal movements of migrant workers and their involvement in other supply chains, such as sugar and 
                        citrus fruits, helping businesses and suppliers better understand their labor force and assess risk within their supply chains. 
                        Furthermore, the project identified approaches to strengthen engagement with particularly vulnerable migrant workers, including 
                        integrating women into interventions. In 2018, the project published a report, {" "}

                <h2>Forced Labor and Trafficking in Persons</h2>
                <p>
                    If a business identifies forced labor or trafficking within its supply chain, responses can vary depending on the type and circumstances of 
                    the victims&rsquo; situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If auditors encounter, or if there are any reports of, egregious situations of forced labor or trafficking, such as worker confinement or 
                    physical or psychological abuse, these situations should be reported to law enforcement authorities. It is incumbent upon auditors and other 
                    members of your social compliance team know the appropriate law enforcement contacts and local law enforcement contexts ahead of worksite visits. 
                    In environments where law enforcement officials may not be fully trained in handling egregious cases of abuse, auditors and other personnel should 
                    also be aware of victim services that are available&mdash;including health care, counseling, shelter, legal aid, and other services&mdash;and be 
                    prepared to refer victims to such services.

                <p>
                    Debt bondage or other forms of financial entrapment are indicators of forced labor and trafficking and require a careful examination of all 
                    circumstances to determine the appropriate response. If it is found that workers are indebted because the supplier has been charging unreasonable 
                    costs for lodging, food, or other expenses, the company should require that the supplier nullify the debt or reduce it to an amount that is 
                    reasonable for the goods and services provided. The situation becomes more egregious if the supplier has charged workers interest on these debts. 
                    In such cases, you will need to give serious consideration to the supplier&rsquo;s overall commitment to your social compliance requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it is found that workers owe debts to a recruiter or labor broker, further investigation may be necessary to determine whether the supplier 
                    was aware that the broker had charged these fees or did not have a policy in place prohibiting brokers from charging fees. If the supplier was 
                    aware or did not have a policy in place to actively deter such practices, the supplier should be held financially responsible for repaying fees 
                    to the workers. If the supplier was actively engaged in discouraging its brokers from charging workers a fee, and the broker did so but 
                    concealed this practice from the supplier, a company may consider taking steps to obtain reimbursement from the broker or may simply choose to 
                    pay the fees to workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Audits may also uncover situations in which workers are forced to work overtime, with or without legal overtime pay. Regardless of pay, 
                    if workers are made to work long hours (i.e., beyond legal limits in the country) under threat of penalty, this is a situation of forced labor. 
                    Remediation of these situations requires careful consideration, including with respect to how your own practices have affected the situation. 
                    Quick turn-around times and last-minute changes in specifications on the part of buyers frequently lead to situations of mandatory overtime. 
                    Companies should encourage suppliers to be honest if they cannot complete an order without violating the terms of the code of conduct, and 
                    companies should reward them rather than simply moving their business to another supplier. Refer to training for a company&rsquo;s employees 
                    for more information on avoiding these situations.
