                    In addition to addressing individual victim situations, it
                    is important to analyze why a violation occurred. This
                    analysis is different than simply attributing child labor
                    and forced labor to poverty, ineffective government
                    institutions, and other reasons, which are discussed in
                    Addressing Root Causes.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some cases, and as noted above, a company&rsquo;s own
                    actions&mdash;such as pressure to fill orders by a set date
                    or sudden changes in volume/style&mdash;could be causing
                    situations where suppliers are pressured to require
                    overtime, bring in additional labor using brokers or
                    recruiters that may not be fully compliant, and/or
                    subcontract to unauthorized contractors to get the work
                    done. In many other cases, management failures and breakdown
                    of policies, processes and/or training at the worksite are
                    the main causes of violations, and these issues can and
                    should be remedied.

                    <p>
                        Lack of clear procedures to ensure that all workers have
                        contracts that clearly stipulate their employment terms,
                        in a language they understand and that any changes to
                        contracts are made with the informed written consent of

                        Lack of policies and procedures for migrant workers,
                        including mechanisms to ensure that migrant workers are
                        not charged fees by brokers/agents, are not required to
                        post deposits and receive employment terms and

                    Of course, causes of violations can go beyond mere system
                    failures, and can result from deliberate deception on the
                    part of the supplier, management, certain employees and/or
                    labor recruiters. Whether accidental or deliberate,
                    violations should be remedied through a clear Corrective
                    Action Plan that holds the supplier accountable.

                <p>
                    Tables 1-4 describe some remediation actions that can be
                    taken when indicators of forced labor are found. In all
                    cases, issues should be documented and tracked and
                    management systems should be updated to prevent recurrence.

                                    wages for all overtime hours worked. Work
                                    with the supplier to evaluate staffing
                                    policies and compensation practices, such as

                                    including excessive overtime. Ensure that
                                    all workers receive training on their rights

                                    If a supervisor or other individual is
                                    leading workers to believe they cannot leave
                                    because the supplier has provided training
                                    or other benefits, or because of an illegal
                                    contractual requirement, require the

                                    action against this individual, from
                                    training to termination. If workers simply

                                    training to ensure they know when they may

                                    their full wages due.

                                    accurately and that all employees involved
                                    in payroll are adequately trained in wage
                                    computation. Require the supplier to pay all
                                    wages due under local law (for example, if
                                    local law requires payment biweekly, require
                                    all wages to be paid, at a minimum, through
                                    two weeks ago). Ensure that payment
                                    schedules are formalized, within legal
                                    limits and the limits of your code. Follow
                                    up with an unannounced audit. Ensure that

                                    to do so and receive their full wages due.

                                    determine whether the terms were reasonable.
                                    If not, work out reasonable terms between

                        Better Work encourages the development of democratic
                        industrial relations structures and processes by
                        including representatives of employers&rsquo;
                        organizations and trade unions in designing and
                        implementing its programs. At the factory level,
                        compliance issues identified through assessments are
                        addressed by a Performance Improvement Consultative
                        Committee (PICC), a body of 8&ndash;10 persons
                        comprising an equal number of management and worker
                        representatives. Where possible, the formation and
                        capacity development of the PICC builds on a
                        factory&rsquo;s existing effective labor management
                        structures. Each PICC meets at least on a monthly basis.
                        Supported by Better Work Advisors, they formulate e and
                        oversee implementation of a remediation plan, ensuring
                        that management and workers share responsibility and
                        accountability throughout the process. Better Work
                        Advisors are available to provide technical assistance
                        and conduct follow-up visits to evaluate progress on the
                        remediation plan.
