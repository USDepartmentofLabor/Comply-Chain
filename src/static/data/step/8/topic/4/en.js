                <p>
                    Particularly in cases where a complaint was received,
                    leading to an audit and finding of violations, the submitter
                    of the complaint&mdash;and possibly other
                    stakeholders&mdash;will expect to know how the issue was
                    handled. Your communication and public reporting should
                    incorporate information about remediation to the extent
                    possible. All such communication should ensure maximum
                    protection for victims&rsquo; safety and privacy.
