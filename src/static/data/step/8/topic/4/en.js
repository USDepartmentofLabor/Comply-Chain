                <h1>Corrective Action Plans</h1>
                <p>
                    A Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is typically formulated shortly after the audit. Companies handle their development in different ways: some 
                    develop CAPs themselves based on audit findings; some require the supplier to draft its own CAP for review and approval by the company; 
                    some require the vendor or agency to draft a CAP for its supplier. In some cases, auditors themselves develop the CAP, but this approach 
                    raises concerns, because it may present a conflict of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is good practice to provide opportunities for worker and community input into a CAP. If individual workers are affected by violations, 
                    they should have access to grievance procedures (See Grievance Mechanisms) and should have the right to representation. Negotiation and 
                    agreement on specific remedies can be done through unions or workers&rsquo; organizations where available, or through a civil society 
                    organization or directly with individual workers, according to defined procedures.
                </p>
                <p>A CAP should include:</p>
                <ul >
                <li>All audit findings.</li>
                <li>The specific action(s) required to remedy each finding, including assistance for individual victims; new written policies or procedures; training for managers, staff, and employees; and other actions.</li>
                <li>Who is responsible for each action.</li>
                <li>How each action will be verified and confirmed, such as record review, employee interviews, spot-checks, or other means.</li>
                <li>The deadline or milestones for completing each action, which normally should be as expeditious as possible.</li>
                <li>Potential consequences if actions are not taken.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, if workers are found to be in forced labor in a workplace, the CAP may require one or more of the remediation measures in 
                    Tables 1&ndash;4 under Preventing Recurrence. It should clearly specify who is responsible for overseeing and following up on each measure. 
                    It may require the establishment of new procedures and clarifying the lines of responsibility for implementing these procedures. The CAP may 
                    establish new &ldquo;check&rdquo; mechanisms to detect forced labor in the workplace and specify who is responsible for conducting these 
                    checks. It may also require a training session for all management on the issue of forced labor and the code of conduct&rsquo;s forced labor 
                    requirements. Finally, the CAP may state what actions the company will take if this violation is repeated, such as temporary suspension of 
                    orders or cancellation of future orders.

                    Once a CAP is in place, oversight and follow-up are, of course, critical. Typically, the company tracks implementation of the CAP, checking 
                    back with the supplier on progress, particularly at the times when milestones were to be reached. If the company has personnel in the 
                    geographic location, they can check back directly, the original audit team can return to do a follow-up, or another audit team can do so. 
                    The company can also hold its vendors or agents responsible for follow-up. The important point is not who does it, but that it is done in a 
                    timely and effective manner and is founded on clear communication with the supplier. As part of CAP implementation, many companies provide 
                    ongoing training and capacity-building to support the supplier in the process of continuous improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite their clear incentive to maintain a positive business relationship with a company, occasionally suppliers will not engage effectively 
                    on CAPs either because they do not have adequate support or training, or they do not perceive an incentive to do so. Therefore, CAPs should 
                    include incentives for suppliers such as a price premium, purchase guarantees, access to financing and/or regular public reporting that rewards 
                    compliance. If remediation and engagement efforts have failed to achieve the desired results, you should consider ending your sourcing 
                    relationship with this supplier, considering the potential impacts on the workers and attempting to mitigate those impacts in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In cases in which the audit uncovers state-sponsored forced labor, for example in Xinjiang, China, remediation measures and corrective action 
                    may be limited to terminating the relationship with the supplier. For example, importers may develop zero-tolerance policies where any confirmed 
                    instances of forced labor by suppliers may result in termination of the business relationship. When ending a business relationship, it is also 
                    recommended that the importer mitigate impacts on the workers, where possible, such as by communicating and engaging with the supplier and 
                    workers on the decision and timeline for disengagement.

                        A lack of compliance and incomplete Best Buy-approved CAP can lead to a termination of the contract with the factory. Best Buy also has 
                        acknowledged taking steps to engage beyond first-tier suppliers to respond to allegations of forced labor in raw material sourcing and 
                        engage smelters who may be sourcing from mines where forced labor may be present.
