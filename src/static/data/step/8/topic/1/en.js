                <h1>The Importance of Violation Remediation</h1>
                <p>Businesses should respond to any identified violation. It is important to note, however, that violations are often found outside of audits&mdash;they 
                    are uncovered through a complaint, referral, or other reporting mechanism, formal or otherwise. Regardless of how businesses are made aware of 
                    potential violations, businesses should investigate and, when necessary, remediate confirmed violations. Various stakeholders should play a role in 
                    remediation: the management of the supplier facility should be committed to correcting the violations; the company should have the necessary mechanisms 
                    to ensure the technical assistance and support needed for correction; and workers, unions, or workers&rsquo; organizations should be partners in 
                    identifying which remediation actions will work best.

                <h2> <em>Withhold Release Orders</em></h2>
                <p>
                    Withhold Release Orders (WROs), issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), direct CBP&rsquo;s Port Directors at ports of entry, a place where 
                    one may lawfully enter a country and/or import goods, to detain a shipment of goods. CBP can detain any shipment when it has reason to believe that the 
                    goods (or their inputs) were made with forced labor, forced child labor, or prison labor under Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. &sect; 
                    1307), which specifically prohibits the importation of all goods made with forced labor, forced child labor, or prison labor. CBP has issued WROs for 
                    goods from unique firms or from regions or even countries. After detention, the goods are held at the port of entry, where the importer can either prove 
                    to CBP that the goods were not made with forced labor, forced child labor, or prison labor, or they can have the goods re-exported. After a period with 
                    no resolution to the issue, the goods may even be destroyed. In issuing WROs to detain shipments of goods, CBP can make the decision to issue a WRO at 
                    any time that &ldquo;information available reasonably but not conclusively&rdquo; indicates that merchandise violates Section 307&rsquo;s prohibitions. 
                    CBP&rsquo;s issuances of WROs are publicly listed on their website:{" "}

                    These reports serve as a resource to CBP and other interagency partners. While inclusion of a good in either of ILAB&rsquo;s two lists is not a ban on 
                    importation of those goods into the United States, the inclusion of that good flags that CBP should pay particular attention to the listed goods in 
                    their WRO investigations. CBP also relies on ILAB&rsquo;s reporting to make determinations in issuing, revoking, or modifying WROs. CBP may revoke 
                    WROs or modify them, making exceptions as firms provide documentation to CBP on the origin of their shipments and supply chain sourcing practices, which 
                    demonstrate a consistent absence of forced labor as determined by CBP.

                <p>
                    Informed compliance is the shared responsibility between CBP and the import community, wherein CBP communicates its requirements to the 
                    importer, and the importer, in turn, uses reasonable care to assure that CBP is provided accurate and timely data pertaining to their 
                    importation. A key component of this shared responsibility is that the importer is expected to exercise &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; on 
                    their importing operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reasonable care is understood as a good faith effort to provide the most accurate information possible. To help assist in exercising 
                    reasonable care related to identifying possible labor exploitation in your supply chain, consider the following guidance questions:

                        if forced labor is identified, and the consequences if corrective action is not taken, such as the termination of the contractual
