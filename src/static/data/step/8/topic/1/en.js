                <p>
                    Businesses should respond to any identified violation. 
                    It is important to note, however, that violations are often 
                    found outside of audits—they are uncovered through a complaint 
                    or referral, or other reporting mechanism, formal or otherwise. 
                    Regardless of how businesses are made aware of potential violations, 
                    businesses should investigate and when necessary remediate 
                    confirmed violations. Various stakeholders should play a role in 
                    remediation: the management of the supplier facility should be committed 
                    to correcting the violations; the company should have the
                    necessary mechanisms to ensure the technical assistance and
                    support needed for correction; and workers or workers’
                    organizations should be consulted for their views about
                    which remediation actions will work best.
                </p>

                    Remediation actions should always be designed to both
                    correct the problem found and prevent it from recurring. In
                    the case of child labor and forced labor violations, this
                    means both improving circumstances for individual child
                    labor or forced labor victims and preventing further child
                    labor or forced labor from occurring at the worksite.
