                <h1>Improving Victim Situations</h1>
                <p>
                    Audit teams must be prepared to encounter a broad range of
                    situations with respect to child or forced labor in the
                    workplace, from individualized cases to situations involving
                    systemic and egregious abuse. Prior to the audit, auditors
                    should prepare themselves with knowledge of local resources,
                    including law enforcement and organizations that provide
                    victim services. Companies that have gathered this type of
                    data as part of their risk assessments and communication
                    efforts, and captured it in their information systems, are
                    best equipped to prepare auditors by providing this
                    information in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a guiding principle, auditors&rsquo; immediate actions
                    and the ongoing corrective actions taken by management
                    should focus on what is best for the victims in question.
                    Cases of egregious abuse that contravene local law should be
                    reported to local law enforcement authorities, but this
                    should be done in a manner that ensures the safety and
                    well-being of the victims. Below is general guidance for
                    actions that can be taken in response to various findings of
                    child labor and forced labor.
                </p>
                <h2>Child Labor</h2>
                {/* <h3>Underage Labor</h3> */}
                <p>
                    If the audit identifies a child in the workplace who is
                    under the country&rsquo;s legal working age, the child
                    should be removed from work immediately. If the audit
                    identifies a child who is of legal age to work in the
                    country, the appropriate immediate response depends on the
                    company&rsquo;s code of conduct. If the company has set a
                    minimum age that is higher than the legal minimum, the child
                    should be removed from work immediately if he or she is
                    below that age.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is critical to keep in mind the possible
                    consequences for the child. The child and his or her family
                    will lose income, and unless it is replaced, the child may
                    simply find a different job, potentially under worse
                    conditions for the child&rsquo;s health, safety or
                    well-being. Companies can take steps to mitigate this
                    situation by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Providing a stipend to the child&rsquo;s family to make
                        up for the lost income, if the child&rsquo;s family can
                        be contacted;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Offering the child&rsquo;s job to another member of the
                        family who is of legal age to work;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Providing alternative income generation opportunities to
                        the child&rsquo;s parents or adult relatives;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensuring that the child attends school or an alternative
                        educational facility, paying associated fees as needed
                        and tracking the child until he or she is of age to
                        work;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Providing the child a training or apprenticeship
                        opportunity when he or she is of legal age for such
                        programs, and committing to provide the job back once he
                        or she is of full legal working age;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Linking the child to educational, developmental,
                        psycho-social and other services provided by the
                        government or non-governmental organizations (NGOs); and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the child has been living away from his or her
                        family, reuniting the child with the family while
                        ensuring that it can provide a protective environment,
                        and provide the applicable services.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                {/* <h3>Hazardous Child Labor</h3> */}
                <p>
                    No child under age 18 should be involved in the Worst Forms
                    of Child Labor specified in ILO Convention 182 (see{" "}
                    <Link to="/steps/3">Step 3, Develop a Code of Conduct</Link>
                    ). If children are found in such situations, the best
                    approaches include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Eliminating any dangerous work activities from the
                        child&rsquo;s job, and closely monitoring the
                        child&rsquo;s work activities on an ongoing basis;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Helping the child identify other safe income-earning
                        opportunities, if there is no feasible way to reduce
                        hazards in his or her current work environment;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensuring that the child is not working too many hours or
                        at times that endanger his or her health, well-being or
                        education;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finding a way for the child to make up for the lost
                        income through other earning opportunities, a stipend or
                        family interventions, in the event working hours are
                        reduced; and

                    <p>
                        Since 2011, the U.S.-based Fair Labor Association (FLA)
                        has been assessing working conditions on hazelnut farms
                        in the Black Sea region of Turkey, first as a special
                        project commissioned by the multinational corporation
                        Nestl&eacute;*, and later as a collaboration between the
                        FLA, Nestl&eacute; and two of its Turkey-based hazelnut
                        suppliers, Balsu Gida* and Olam Progida*. Annually, the
                        FLA sends a team of assessors to visit a sample of farms
                        supplying hazelnuts to these companies. The presence of
                        child labor has been a consistent finding, both among
                        local workers&rsquo; families, and among the groups of
                        migrant workers who travel to the region for the
                        hazelnut harvest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The companies have pursued a number of remediation
                        strategies in response to these findings, such as civil
                        society partnerships to build schools and provide
                        scholarships for children of migrant workers and in
                        hazelnut communities. Further interventions have
                        included training for farmers on child labor
                        prohibitions, and the provision of age-verification
                        tools to encourage farmers to document the ages of their
                        hired workers.&nbsp;

                        In November 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor awarded
                        the FLA a grant to pilot-test a comprehensive,
                        sustainable program that implements all elements of the

                <h2>Forced Labor/Trafficking in Persons</h2>
                <p>
                    If the audit identifies forced labor/trafficking victims,
                    responses can vary depending on the type and circumstances
                    of the victim&rsquo;s situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If auditors encounter, or if there are any reports of,
                    egregious situations of forced labor/trafficking, such as
                    worker confinement or physical or psychological abuse, these
                    situations should be reported to law enforcement
                    authorities. It is incumbent upon auditors, and other
                    members of your social compliance team who may visit
                    worksites, to be aware ahead of time of the appropriate law
                    enforcement contacts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, it is important to understand local law
                    enforcement contexts. In environments where law enforcement
                    officials may not be fully trained in handling egregious
                    cases of abuse, auditors and other personnel should also be
                    aware of victim services that are available&mdash;including
                    healthcare, counseling, shelter, legal aid and other
                    services&mdash;and be prepared to refer victims to such
                    services.

                    Debt bondage or other forms of financial entrapment are
                    indicators of forced labor/trafficking, and also require a
                    careful examination of all circumstances to determine the
                    appropriate response. If it is found that workers are
                    indebted because the supplier has been charging unreasonable
                    costs for lodging, food or other expenses, the company
                    should require that the supplier nullify the debt or reduce
                    it to an amount that is reasonable for the goods and
                    services provided. The situation becomes more egregious if
                    the supplier has charged workers interest on these debts,
                    and in such cases you will need to give serious
                    consideration to the supplier&rsquo;s overall commitment to
                    your social compliance requirements.

                    If it is found that workers owe debts to a recruiter or
                    labor broker, further investigation may be necessary to
                    determine whether the supplier was aware that the broker had
                    charged these fees, or did not have a policy in place
                    prohibiting brokers from charging fees. If the supplier was
                    aware, or did not have a policy in place to actively deter
                    such practices, the supplier should be held financially
                    responsible for repaying fees to the workers. If the
                    supplier was actively engaged in discouraging its brokers
                    from charging workers a fee, and the broker did so but
                    concealed this practice from the supplier, a company may
                    consider taking steps to obtain reimbursement from the
                    broker, or may simply choose to pay the fees to workers.

                    Audits may also uncover situations in which workers are
                    forced to work overtime, with or without legal overtime pay.
                    Regardless of pay, if workers are made to work long hours
                    (beyond legal limits in the country) under the threat of
                    penalty, this is a situation of forced labor. Remediation of
                    these situations requires careful consideration, including
                    with respect to how your own practices have affected the
                    situation. Quick turn-around times and last-minute changes
                    in specifications on the part of buyers frequently lead to
                    situations of mandatory overtime. Companies should encourage
                    suppliers to be honest if that cannot complete an order
                    without violating the terms of the code of conduct, and
                    companies should reward them rather than simply moving their
                    business to another supplier. Refer to training for a
                    company&rsquo;s employees for more information on avoiding
                    these situations.
