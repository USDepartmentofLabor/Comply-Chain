                <p>
                    Particularly in cases where a complaint is received and leads to an audit and finding of violations, the submitter of the complaint&mdash;and 
                    possibly other stakeholders&mdash;will expect to know how the issue was handled. Your communication and public reporting should incorporate information 
                    about remediation to the extent possible. All such communication should ensure maximum protection for victims&rsquo; safety and privacy.

                        The demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) saw a large uptick in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As governments and health care 
                        providers scrambled for PPE, rubber glove manufacturers gained international attention as they sought to meet unprecedented demand for 
                        disposable rubber gloves. In turn, the labor practices of companies like Malaysia-based Top Glove, the world&rsquo;s largest rubber 
                        glove manufacturer, came under new scrutiny.
