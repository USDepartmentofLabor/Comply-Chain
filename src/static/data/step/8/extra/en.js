                    Every violation identified in an audit should be remediated.
                    Various stakeholders should play a role in remediation: the
                    management of the supplier facility should be committed to
                    correcting the violations; the company should have the
                    necessary mechanisms to ensure the technical assistance and
                    support needed for correction; and workers or workersâ€™
                    organizations should be consulted for their views about
                    which remediation actions will work best.
                </p>

                <p>
                    {" "}
                    Remediation actions should always be designed to both
                    correct the problem found and prevent it from recurring. In
                    the case of child labor and forced labor violations, this
                    means both improving circumstances for individual child
                    labor or forced labor victims and preventing further child
                    labor or forced labor from occurring at the worksite.
