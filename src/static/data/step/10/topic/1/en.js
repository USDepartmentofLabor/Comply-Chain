                <p>
                    A company&rsquo;s public reporting on its social compliance
                    program, including the auditing and verification processes
                    and other elements of the program discussed in previous
                    sections, may be a stand-alone report or part of a broader
                    sustainability or corporate social responsibility (CSR)
                    report. It may be published in hard copy and/or on a
                    company&rsquo;s website; some companies publish both an
                    annual or other regular hard-copy report and updates online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reporting should also include periodic communication with
                    stakeholders about issues of importance that come up
                    unexpectedly; this type of reporting should be done as
                    needed and as appropriate to the circumstances. Whatever
                    format is chosen, reporting should be timely and regular,
                    and you should make an effort to ensure that key information
                    is accessible to a wide variety of audiences, including
                    those who may not have access to the Internet.
