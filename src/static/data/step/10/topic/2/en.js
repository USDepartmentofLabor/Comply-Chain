                <p>
                    Public reporting on social compliance used to be largely voluntary, although some industry and multi-stakeholder groups required 
                    public disclosure of audit findings and other program elements as conditions for membership. However, several U.S. laws enacted at both

                    companies to share social compliance information with the public&mdash;and increasing numbers of companies have undertaken sharing such information 
                    to demonstrate engagement and leadership in their policies and programs. A recent example is the European Commission&rsquo;s February 2022

                    <h2>Employee Education and Buy-In</h2>
                    <p>
                        Social compliance reporting helps educate everyone in the company about the program, which in turn can foster a greater commitment across 
                        the company to support social compliance and bolster loyalty among employees who value issues related to worker rights.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
                    <p>
                        The process of putting together a report requires the social compliance team to establish or reexamine its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
                        and assess progress against them, as well as benchmark progress against their peer companies. The team should examine issues that have come up 
                        throughout the year, the approaches that were taken to address them, and whether those approaches were successful. The team should also consider 
                        whether its overall program has had any unintended consequences, and, if so, evaluate those.
                    </p>

                    <h2>External Input</h2>
                    <p>
                        Reporting should offer clear processes through which important stakeholders, including workers and local community members, can provide feedback. 
                        Responses to the report can also include media coverage and use of report material in NGO campaigns. Whatever form they take, external responses help 
                        companies to evaluate and continuously improve the system, including the structure and process for future reporting.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Accountability</h2>
                    <p>
                        Public reporting should clearly state the goals of the social compliance program, how the company is pursuing those goals, how it measures progress 
                        against the goals, and the degree of progress to date. This promotes greater accountability both within the company itself and with important external 
                        stakeholders.

                            Since the start of discussions to publish a report in 2015, ANA Group has continued to broaden its understanding of business 
                            and human rights, driven in part by the demands of the international community&rsquo;s growing concern and attention. Due in 
                            part to conversations with human rights experts beginning in 2015, ANA Group developed a{" "}

                            as an initial step to outline the company&rsquo;s progress. However, during this process, voices emerged among management that 
                            expressed concern with the fact that the publication of a human rights report would itself carry risks. Nevertheless, as ANA 
                            Group expanded discussions with experts abroad and in Japan and with the global investor community, the company realized that 
                            publication of a human rights report is, in and of itself, risk management.
