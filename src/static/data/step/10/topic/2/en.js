                <h1>Why Produce Public Reporting?</h1>
                <p>
                    Public reporting on social compliance used to be largely
                    voluntary, although some industry and multi-stakeholder
                    groups required public disclosure of audit findings and
                    other program elements as conditions for membership.
                    However, several U.S. laws enacted at both the state and
                    federal levels, including the{" "}

                    those laws (See Laws and Regulations for more information on
                    public disclosure legislation). Though most reporting is
                    still voluntary, a growing number of consumers, shareholder
                    groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have come
                    to expect companies to share social compliance information
                    with the public &ndash; and increasing numbers of companies
                    have undertaken sharing such information to demonstrate
                    engagement and leadership in their policies and programs.

                <p>
                    Public reporting offers a variety of benefits, both internal
                    and external:&nbsp;

                    <h2>Employee Education and Buy-In</h2>
                    <p>
                        Social compliance reporting helps educate everyone in
                        the company about the program, which in turn can foster
                        a greater commitment across the company to support
                        social compliance and bolster loyalty among employees
                        who value issues related to worker rights.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
                    <p>
                        The process of putting together a report requires the
                        social compliance team to establish and/or reexamine its
                        Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and assess progress
                        against them, as well as benchmark progress against
                        their peer companies. The team should examine issues
                        that have come up throughout the year, the approaches
                        that were taken to address them, and whether those
                        approaches were successful. The team should also
                        consider whether its overall program has had any
                        unintended consequences, and, if so, evaluate those.
                    </p>

                    <h2>External Input</h2>
                    <p>
                        Reporting should offer clear processes through which
                        important stakeholders, including workers and local
                        community members, can provide feedback. Responses to
                        the report can also include media coverage and use of
                        report material in NGO campaigns. Whatever form they
                        take, external responses help companies to evaluate and
                        continuously improve the system, including the structure
                        and process for future reporting.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Accountability</h2>
                    <p>
                        Public reporting should clearly state the goals of the
                        social compliance program, how the company is pursuing
                        those goals, how it measures progress against the goals
                        and the degree of progress to date. This promotes
                        greater accountability both within the company itself
                        and with important external stakeholders.
