                <h1>Report Engagement</h1>
                <p>Beyond the important need for transparency, reports provide a company context with which to engage consumers, stakeholders, and the public on its efforts, successes and challenges, and need for additional action. Companies should bear in mind the diverse audience when reporting on issues of business and human rights, namely company efforts to address child labor and forced labor in global supply chains.</p>
                <p>Certainly, customers increasingly expect their favorite brands and suppliers to adhere to human rights principles and share how human rights issues are proactively identified and addressed. Having good human rights practices in the business sector is an opportunity to gain competitive advantage and build and strengthen relationships with customers. Often, companies, especially public companies, can leverage their annual reporting, including shareholder reports and other required disclosures such as 10-K forms as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to highlight how they are addressing issues of labor rights in global supply chains.</p>
                <p>Beyond acknowledging expectations of customers and the investor community, company reports should also serve to reach other groups impacted by a company&rsquo;s operations. The list below includes examples of the many types of audience and why this reporting may matter to them:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Employees and Workers and Trade Unions</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Motivation and insights into company operations; marketing the brand&rsquo;s story</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Supply Chain Partners</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Messaging about expectations and business relationship</li>

                        The founders sought to build consumer engagement into the design of each and every product sold. To that end, each garment 
                        that Another Tomorrow produces includes a QR code that consumers can scan with their cell phone camera, which directs the 
                        consumer to a website that includes detailed information on the garment&rsquo;s provenance and lifecycle. The website 
                        includes information on where the piece was made and its materials. This level of detail shines a light on the otherwise 
                        murky world of anonymous labor involved in the production of each garment that consumers buy. The higher costs of these 
                        technological solutions are overcome through collaborative action from brands to address the gap of investment needed to 
                        drive transformative change in the industry.

                <h2>Unambiguous human rights strategy interwoven into broader aspects of reporting</h2>
                <p>
                    Reporting is an opportunity to interweave human rights work. Reports and disclosures provide consumers and other stakeholders with 
                    information about key human rights risks, but also opportunities, vision, and goals. Furthermore, the publication of reports is a 
                    chance for a company to explore strategy implementation at the operational level and/or local level. These reports include not just 
                    annual reports but also sustainability reports and other required reporting, such as the annual Form 10-K required by the SEC of 
                    publicly traded companies, which includes information on, among other things, risks that a company faces. As an example, HP&rsquo;s

                        global supply chains. KnowTheChain benchmarks current corporate practices, develops insights, and provides practical 
                        resources that inform investor decisions and enable companies to comply with growing legal obligations while operating 
                        more transparently and responsibly.

                    <p>
                        The KnowTheChain benchmarks aim to help companies protect the well-being of workers by incentivizing companies and 
                        identifying gaps in each sector evaluated. The summary of the 2020&ndash;2021 benchmark leader Lululemon Athletica Inc.

                        suppliers, detail on the implementation of its responsible recruitment program in Taiwan (and expansion of the program to 
                        several other countries), and efforts to improve freedom of association. Notably, the company has the highest score on the 
                        themes of Purchasing Practices, Recruitment, and Remedy. The company discloses having taken limited steps to address the 
                        risks of alleged Uyghur forced labor across its supply chain tiers, namely, that it trained suppliers and carried out 
                        &ldquo;additional due diligence research&rdquo; on its cotton supply chain. However, it does not disclose engagement with 
                        groups representing rightsholders or timebound targets. KnowTheChain identified one additional allegation of forced labor 
                        in the company&rsquo;s supply chains. The company discloses it conducted more than 650 confidential worker interviews and 
                        notes that supervisors responsible for the alleged abuses were removed, but it does not disclose further remedy outcomes for 
                        workers. The company has an opportunity to improve its performance and disclosure on the themes of Purchasing Practices,

                <p>
                    Incorporating viewpoints from stakeholders, including consumers and other groups impacted by a company&rsquo;s operations, helps to promote 
                    honest discussions that address these challenges and yield more detailed information. Engagement with community members, human rights experts, 
                    key NGO partners, and workers&mdash;and understanding their perspectives on the company&rsquo;s activities and the impact they have had&mdash;is 
                    helpful to paint a full picture of the human rights engagement piece.

                    A clear recognition of the challenges that a company faces is essential to discussions that foster shared solutions among key stakeholders.

                    Measurement of impact continues to be a laudable yet troublesome goal. Reporting that contrasts both quantitative metrics and qualitative
