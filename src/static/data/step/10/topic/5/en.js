                <h1>Report Engagement</h1>
                <p>
                Beyond the important need for transparency, reports provide a company 
                context with which to engage its consumers, stakeholders, and the general 
                public on its efforts, successes and challenges, and need for additional action. 
                Companies should bear in mind the diverse audience for reporting on issues of 
                business and human rights, namely company efforts to address child labor and 
                forced labor in global supply chains.
                </p>
                <p>
                Certainly, customers increasingly expect their favorite brands and suppliers to adhere
                 to human rights principles and share how human rights issues are proactively identified
                  and addressed.  With this in mind, good human rights practices in the business sector
                   is an opportunity to gain competitive advantage and build and strengthen relationships
                    with customers. Often companies, especially public companies, can leverage their 
                    annual reporting, including shareholder reports and other required disclosures such 
                    as 10-K forms as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to highlight
                     how the company is addressing issues of labor rights in global supply chains.
                </p>
                <p>
                However, beyond customers and the investor community, company reports should also serve
                 to reach other groups impacted by a company&rsquo;s operations. The below list includes just a 
                 number of the many audiences and why this reporting may matter to them:

                    *  The founders sought to build consumer engagement into the design of each 
                    and every product sold.  To that end, each garment that Another Tomorrow 
                    produces includes a QR code, that consumers can scan with their phone camera, 
                    which directs one to a website that includes detailed information on the garment&rsquo;s 
                    provenance and lifecycle. The website includes information on where the piece 
                    was made and its materials. This level of detail is a light on the otherwise 
                    murky world of anonymous labor involved in the production of each garment 
                    that you as a consumer wear. The higher costs of these technological solutions 
                    are overcome through collaborative action from brands to address the gap of investment 
                    needed to drive transformative change in the industry.

                The highlights below provide an overview of the way companies can 
                engage various stakeholders through the use of their public reporting 
                and other outreach efforts  
                </p>

                <h2>Unambiguous human rights strategy interwoven into broader aspects of reporting</h2>
                <p>
                Reporting is an opportunity to interweave human rights work. Reports and disclosures
                 provide consumers and other stakeholders with information on key human rights risks, 
                 but also opportunities, vision, and goals. Furthermore, the publication of reports is
                  a chance for a company to explore strategy implementation at the operational level 
                  and/or local level. These reports include not just annual reports, but also 
                  sustainability reports, and also other required reporting such as the annual Form 
                  10-K required by the SEC of publicly-traded companies that includes information 
                  on, among other things, risks that a company faces.  As an example, HP&rsquo;s efforts
                   to focus {" "}

                   provides both outcomes and commitments.
                </p>

                <h2>Human rights linked to core competencies of the business</h2>
                <p>
                Sustaining efforts to engage consumers on human rights issues and promote 
                wider impact depend on the ability to tie those efforts and that impact 
                to a company&rsquo;s core competency. Consider British multinational pharmaceutical 
                company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)&rsquo;s ability to link positive health outcomes to 
                the company&rsquo;s work on broader social determinants of health, such as {" "}

                . 
                </p>

                <h2>Inclusion of stakeholder viewpoints into reporting</h2>
                <p>
                Incorporating viewpoints from stakeholders, including consumers and other 
                groups impacted by a company&rsquo;s operations, helps to promote honest discussions
                 on addressing these challenges that yield more detailed information. 
                 Engagement with community members, human rights experts, key NGO partners, 
                 and workers, along with their perspectives on a company&rsquo;s activities and the 
                 impact they have had are helpful to paint a full picture of the human rights 
                 engagement piece.
                </p>

                <h2>Acknowledgment of challenges faced by the company</h2>
                 <p>
                 A clear recognition of the challenges that a company faces are essential 
                 to discussions that foster shared solutions among key stakeholders. 
                 Companies should strive to report on challenges in a transparent way. 
                 Nestlé is one such company that has consistently reported on its progress 
                 and persistent challenges related to eradicating child labor in cocoa 
                 production through its annual {" "}

                 <h2>Qualitative and quantitative reporting each play a role</h2>
                 <p>
                 Measurement of impact continues to be a laudable, yet troublesome goal. 
                 Reporting that contrasts both quantitative metrics and qualitative reporting is 
                 vital to addressing consumer concerns in a robust and authentic way. For example,
