                <h1>What to Include in Public Reporting </h1>
                <p>
                    Public reports should include a description and discussion
                    of all elements of the social compliance system, from the
                    code of conduct, to community and multi-stakeholder
                    involvement, risk assessment, training, auditing,
                    remediation, independent verification and efforts to address
                    root causes. Reports should also discuss the implementing
                    environments in which the company&rsquo;s social compliance
                    system operates, and the challenges in those environments.
                    Many social compliance reports also highlight the various
                    individuals and organizations partnering with the company to
                    help achieve the program&rsquo;s goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reports should be written in straightforward language that
                    diverse audiences can understand and translated into
                    relevant languages. They should present the aspects of the
                    system that are working well, and also the elements that
                    have been less successful, including lessons learned and
                    plans for improvement. Being open about weaknesses while
                    showing that the company understands and is actively
                    addressing them is an important aspect of accountability in
                    public reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important that public reporting, while maximizing
                    transparency, at the same time avoids posing any risks to
                    specific individuals or organizations. This could include
                    workers, suppliers and other stakeholders. It is also
                    important to keep in mind commercial confidentiality
                    considerations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your social compliance report is embedded within a larger
                    company sustainability or CSR report, guidance is available
                    for developing such reports. A recommended resource is the{" "}

                        metrics. When calculating performance against metrics,
                        it is important for many companies to segregate
                        performance within the company from performance in the
                        company&rsquo;s supply chain. Aggregating the two can
                        mask the realities of supply chain performance.</p>

                                        What makes ice cream smooth and creamy and keeps chocolate from melting? 
                                        The answer is palm oil, which is in approximately half of the packaged 
                                        products we buy at the supermarket. Palm oil is in everything from lipstick 
                                        to pizza dough, from non-dairy creamers to automotive cleaners. It is 
                                        even used to make biodiesel fuels. While the cultivation of palm has 
                                        been an important motor of economic development around the globe, 
                                        including in Southeast Asia, which accounts for more than 85 percent 
                                        of the world&rsquo;s product, the supply is often tainted by child labor. 
                                        In Indonesia and Malaysia, for example, children work alongside their 
                                        parents, who often must meet harvest quotas to avoid wage deductions and 
                                        other penalties. On the plantations, they are exposed to toxic chemicals 
                                        and risk injury from carrying heavy loads. Children toiling in the palm 
                                        oil industry—whether in Southeast Asia, Africa, or Latin America—often work 
                                        long hours and miss school. So, what are leading producers and retailers 
                                        doing to combat child labor in the global palm supply, and how can consumers 
                                        make informed decisions at the supermarket?

                                     HP Inc. (HP) is an American information technology multinational that 
                                     develops personal computers, printers, and related equipment. In fact, 
                                     HP is the world’s largest vendor of personal computers. The manufacturing 
                                     of personal computers requires small amounts of various metals, such as 
                                     tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. Sadly, a number of groups has sought 
                                     to capture revenue from the mining of these minerals—known collectively 
                                     as “3TGs” to use as funding for the perpetration of human rights violations 
                                     in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighboring countries. 
                                     HP, like many large companies, has the most direct control over its 
                                     immediate Tier 1 suppliers; however, the persistence of these abuses requires 
                                     companies to explore ways to influence the behavior of those suppliers closer 
                                     to the source of these raw materials, namely ore smelters.

                                              In 2008, media reports put a spotlight on Hytex Apparel,
                                              Inc.*, a Malaysian company contracting with Nike, Inc.
                                              The reports focused on mistreatment of hundreds of
                                              migrant workers. Nike investigated and found that
                                              although Hytex was not breaking any of Malaysian
                                              immigration law, the dormitories for workers did not
                                              meet Nike&rsquo;s standards. In addition, several of
                                              Hytex&rsquo;s practices, including wage garnishment and
                                              withholding of personal documents such as passports,
                                              were in violation of Nike&rsquo;s supplier code of
                                              conduct even if not of national law.&nbsp;
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              Nike worked with Hytex to return documents to workers,
                                              repay workers their garnished wages and improve the
                                              dormitories. Hytex also agreed to cover expenses for
                                              workers who wanted to return to their home countries.
                                              The situation with Hytex spurred Nike to develop its
                                              current policies and code provisions on migrant labor.
