                <h1>What to Include in Public Reporting </h1>
                <p>
                    Public reports should include a description and discussion of all elements of the social compliance system, from the code of conduct 
                    to community and multi-stakeholder involvement, risk assessment, training, auditing, remediation, independent verification, and efforts 
                    to address root causes. Reports should also discuss the environments in which the company&rsquo;s social compliance system is implemented 
                    and operates, and the challenges in those environments. Many social compliance reports also highlight the various individuals and 
                    organizations partnering with the company to help achieve the program&rsquo;s goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reports should be written in straightforward language that diverse audiences can understand and that can be translated into relevant 
                    languages. They should present the aspects of the system that are working well, as well as the elements that have been less successful, 
                    including lessons learned and plans for improvement. Being open about weaknesses while showing that the company understands and is actively 
                    addressing them is an important aspect of accountability in public reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important that public reporting, while maximizing transparency, at the same time avoids posing any risks to specific individuals or 
                    organizations. This could include workers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. It is also important to keep in mind commercial confidentiality 
                    considerations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a best practice in public reporting to fully engage all stakeholders in the process to collaboratively develop, draft, and communicate 
                    public reporting. The direct involvement of workers, either collectively or through worker feedback mechanisms, facilitates a variety of 
                    positive benefits, both internal and external.
                </p>

                    The People&rsquo;s Republic of China has arbitrarily detained more than one million Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in 
                    China&rsquo;s far western Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, 
                    Kyrgyz, and other ethnic and mostly Muslim religious minorities are being subjected to forced labor following detention in re-education 
                    camps. The government also exploits some non-interned members of minority communities in forced labor through labor transfer programs.

                    since 2009, when four goods believed to be produced with forced labor in Xinjiang were added to the TVPRA List: cotton, garments, 
                    footwear, and electronics. In 2020, ILAB added five goods produced by forced labor by Muslim minorities in China to the 2020 edition of 
                    the TVPRA list: gloves, hair products, textiles, thread/yarn, and tomato products. In 2021, ILAB added polysilicon, which is used in 
                    the production of solar panels. This was an unprecedented special addition, outside the usual biannual update of the list. China now has 
                    the highest number of goods listed for being made with forced labor of any country in the world. Although China is a closed country that

                        While child labor and forced labor can occur at any stage in a company&rsquo;s supply chain, research indicates that the 
                        risk of these exploitative labor practices is often greatest in upstream production activities, such as raw material 
                        extraction and agricultural production, which serve as inputs to other industries. Yet, to date, the scope of tracing and 
                        research in this area has mostly been restricted to first-tier primary suppliers. As supply chains become more complex, tracking 
                        a vast number of suppliers to trace the origins of products, particularly the raw sources from upstream in the supply chain, 
                        remains a significant challenge.&nbsp;

                        personal computers requires small amounts of various metals, such as tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. Sadly, a

                        as &ldquo;3TGs&rdquo;&mdash;to use as funding for the perpetration of human rights violations in the Democratic Republic 
                        of the Congo and its neighboring countries. HP, like many large companies, has the most direct control over its immediate 
                        first-tier suppliers; however, the persistence of these abuses requires companies to explore ways to influence the behavior 
                        of those suppliers closer to the source of these raw materials, namely ore smelters.

                                              In 2008, media reports put a spotlight on Hytex Apparel,
                                              Inc.*, a Malaysian company contracting with Nike, Inc.
                                              The reports focused on mistreatment of hundreds of
                                              migrant workers. Nike investigated and found that
                                              although Hytex was not breaking any of Malaysian
                                              immigration law, the dormitories for workers did not
                                              meet Nike&rsquo;s standards. In addition, several of
                                              Hytex&rsquo;s practices, including wage garnishment and
                                              withholding of personal documents such as passports,
                                              were in violation of Nike&rsquo;s supplier code of
                                              conduct even if not of national law.&nbsp;

                                              Nike worked with Hytex to return documents to workers,
                                              repay workers their garnished wages and improve the
                                              dormitories. Hytex also agreed to cover expenses for
                                              workers who wanted to return to their home countries.
                                              The situation with Hytex spurred Nike to develop its
                                              current policies and code provisions on migrant labor.
