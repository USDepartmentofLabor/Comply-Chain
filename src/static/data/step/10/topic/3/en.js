                <h1>What to Include in Public Reporting </h1>
                <p>
                    Public reports should include a description and discussion
                    of all elements of the social compliance system, from the
                    code of conduct, to community and multi-stakeholder
                    involvement, risk assessment, training, auditing,
                    remediation, independent verification and efforts to address
                    root causes. Reports should also discuss the implementing
                    environments in which the company&rsquo;s social compliance
                    system operates, and the challenges in those environments.
                    Many social compliance reports also highlight the various
                    individuals and organizations partnering with the company to
                    help achieve the program&rsquo;s goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reports should be written in straightforward language that
                    diverse audiences can understand and translated into
                    relevant languages. They should present the aspects of the
                    system that are working well, and also the elements that
                    have been less successful, including lessons learned and
                    plans for improvement. Being open about weaknesses while
                    showing that the company understands and is actively
                    addressing them is an important aspect of accountability in
                    public reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important that public reporting, while maximizing
                    transparency, at the same time avoids posing any risks to
                    specific individuals or organizations. This could include
                    workers, suppliers and other stakeholders. It is also
                    important to keep in mind commercial confidentiality
                    considerations.
                </p>
                <p>

                        it is important for many companies to segregate

                                              In 2008, media reports put a spotlight on Hytex Apparel,
                                              Inc.*, a Malaysian company contracting with Nike, Inc.
                                              The reports focused on mistreatment of hundreds of
                                              migrant workers. Nike investigated and found that
                                              although Hytex was not breaking any of Malaysian
                                              immigration law, the dormitories for workers did not
                                              meet Nike&rsquo;s standards. In addition, several of
                                              Hytex&rsquo;s practices, including wage garnishment and
                                              withholding of personal documents such as passports,
                                              were in violation of Nike&rsquo;s supplier code of
                                              conduct even if not of national law.&nbsp;
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              Nike worked with Hytex to return documents to workers,
                                              repay workers their garnished wages and improve the
                                              dormitories. Hytex also agreed to cover expenses for
                                              workers who wanted to return to their home countries.
                                              The situation with Hytex spurred Nike to develop its
                                              current policies and code provisions on migrant labor.
