                <h1>The Reporting Team</h1>
                <p>
                    Planning for report production depends to some extent on how
                    often you report and in what form. A formal annual report
                    requires somewhat different skills from those required for
                    periodic web-based data updates, but both require
                    substantial investments of time and resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The social compliance team should designate a person to lead
                    the reporting process, with other team members assigned to
                    assist. That person will coordinate with the team but also
                    with the other business units throughout the company. Points
                    of contact throughout the company should be assigned to
                    provide input and review the report so that it reflects the
                    integration of social compliance throughout the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other companies contract with an external service provider
                    to develop the report. Information is provided to the
                    service provider from relevant units within the company. The
                    risk of this approach is whether it will produce the same
                    quality and depth of collaboration during the development of
                    the report.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some companies have external stakeholders who serve as
                    advisors to the team or as members of the team itself. In
                    this case, these should be individuals with experience and
                    expertise in social compliance, but who come from a
                    different background or perspective from that of the other
                    team members. In addition, it can be useful to have external
                    readers provide comments and feedback as the reporting is
                    developed; in the spirit of openness and transparency, some
                    companies have invited representatives of labor groups, NGOs
                    and other stakeholders to have excerpts of their comments
                    included in the published report itself, even where those
                    may be critical of some of the company&rsquo;s program.
