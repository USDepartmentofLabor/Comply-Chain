                Every violation identified in an audit should be remediated.
                Various stakeholders should play a role in remediation: the
                management of the supplier facility should be committed to
                correcting the violations; the company should have the necessary
                mechanisms to ensure the technical assistance and support needed
                for correction; and workers or workers’ organizations should be
                consulted for their views about which remediation actions will
                work best.
            </p>

            <p>
                {" "}
                Remediation actions should always be designed to both correct
                the problem found and prevent it from recurring. In the case of
                child labor and forced labor violations, this means both
                improving circumstances for individual child labor or forced
                labor victims and preventing further child labor or forced labor
                from occurring at the worksite.
