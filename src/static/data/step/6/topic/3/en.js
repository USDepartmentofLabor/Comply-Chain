                Training on the types of data the social compliance team gathers, and how to use that data in making product development and sourcing decisions, is essential. It is also useful to review ongoing information regarding the social compliance performance of suppliers. It is critical to discuss with a company’s product developers and buyers the impact of their practices and decisions on social compliance. Ideally, the performance evaluation and incentive structures of these teams should be informed by the degree to which they make use of social compliance data. Buy-in and participation from the highest levels of the company may be necessary in these discussions.

                Communication via newsletters, e-mails, annual reports, annual meetings, or other means will help ensure that all employees are aware of the company’s commitment to social compliance. Another approach is using an incentive or award system that rewards top performers in social responsibility.

                <h2>Suppliers Beyond the First Tier</h2>

                <p>
                Your training and capacity-building programs should extend to suppliers beyond the first tier. Once your risk assessment has identified the areas of your supply chains at greatest risk of child labor, forced labor, and other labor abuses, you should have an idea of which suppliers, at all tiers, are in most need of training. The training materials you have developed for first-tier suppliers can be adapted for other levels of the supply chain. As previously noted, you may also require that vendors, agents, or suppliers provide this training. Note that some companies achieve efficiencies by bringing together multiple suppliers—for instance, all suppliers operating in the same country or geographic region—to be trained together.

                </p>

                <h2>Workers and Trade Unions</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Responsibilities in the workplace</li>
                <li>Core labor standards: freedom from forced labor, freedom from child labor, freedom from discrimination at work, freedom to form and join a union and to bargain collectively, and occupational safety and health&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Additional workplace rights not covered in the core training content, such as rights under local law&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Proper procedures for recording hours of work</li>
                <li>Understanding pay slips, calculating wages and deductions</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Red flags&rdquo; to identify child labor, forced labor, and trafficking</li>
                <li>Computation of wages, including piece rates, overtime, bonuses, and legal, permitted deductions</li>
                <li>Policies to ensure timely and accurate payment of wages</li>
                <li>Appropriate age-verification documentation</li>
                <li>Policies on appropriate treatment of children identified at worksites</li>
