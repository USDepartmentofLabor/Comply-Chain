                <p>
                    Grievance mechanisms are the cornerstone of collective
                    bargaining. They allow workers to raise issues with
                    employers without fear of reprisal. However, workers without
                    the protection of a collective bargaining agreement should
                    also have ways to make anonymous complaints and should have
                    whistleblower protections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies should ensure that safe, accessible channels are
                    available to workers to lodge complaints about any issue
                    related to your code of conduct. Ideally, multiple channels
                    should be available, such as through trade unions (if
                    available), through supervisors or supplier management,
                    directly to a company, or to a third-party that you engage
                    for this purpose. Procedures for bringing a grievance to
                    each available channel should be clearly explained at
                    training sessions and posted at the worksite, in all
                    applicable languages. When auditors and/or independent
                    verification organizations visit worksites, workers should
                    be encouraged to make known any complaints to them in a
                    confidential setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Standard procedures should also be in place for handling and
                    resolving complaints that are received through all channels.
                    These procedures should be clearly explained and posted. The
                    procedures should include protection of privacy and
                    protection from reprisal for the person or group bringing
                    the complaint, as well as a communications protocol to
                    notify both the complainant and other affected stakeholders
                    of the outcome of the grievance.

                    Technology is playing an increasing role in the ability of
                    companies, labor unions, civil society organizations, and
                    third-party monitoring groups to capture worker feedback on

                    comment on labor recruiters and contractors in their native
                    languages. Technologies that capture &ldquo;worker
                    voice&rdquo; are often cost effective, targeted, and safe
                    for workers. They can provide a valuable supplement to
                    traditional social audits, as well as provide effective
                    mechanisms for educating workers on their rights and
                    available resources. Many available technologies provide
                    pathways to report worker grievances but do not provide
                    avenues for remedying individual violations of worker
                    rights; this is an area of need and an opportunity for
                    further technology development.&nbsp;

                    Unilever* is a British-Dutch multinational company that produces a wide range of products that use palm-oil as an ingredient. 
                    Unilever works closely with its suppliers to promote decent work standards across its palm-oil supply chain, including developing 
                    a process by which workers’ grievances can be communicated and addressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The process includes three important steps:

                    <li>
                    An acknowledgement of the grievance and a preliminary review to determine whether the grievance is applicable to our supply chain.

                    <li>
                    An in-depth review of the grievance, working with the supplier and an independent organization to develop a time-bound action and remediation plan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Actions implemented by the supplier to resolve the issue, with the outcomes monitored.

                <p>
                    Unilever will often involve an independent organization at various stages to collate further information and outline
