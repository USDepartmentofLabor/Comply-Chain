                <p>Many people and organizations have roles in making your social compliance system work, and each of these roles is essential. The better everyone understands their roles and responsibilities, the better the system will function. Beyond training its own employees who have social compliance responsibilities, a company should look to the following parties across its supply chain:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Your employees</li>
                <li>Vendors or agents, if applicable</li>
