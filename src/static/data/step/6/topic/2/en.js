            <p>
                In addition to addressing individual victim situations, it is
                important to analyze why a violation occurred. This analysis is
                different than simply attributing child labor and forced labor
                to poverty, ineffective government institutions, and other
                reasons, which are discussed in Addressing Root Causes.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                In some cases, and as noted above, a company&rsquo;s own
                actions&mdash;such as pressure to fill orders by a set date or
                sudden changes in volume/style&mdash;could be causing situations
                where suppliers are pressured to require overtime, bring in
                additional labor using brokers or recruiters that may not be
                fully compliant, and/or subcontract to unauthorized contractors
                to get the work done. In many other cases, management failures
                and breakdown of policies, processes and/or training at the
                worksite are the main causes of violations, and these issues can
                and should be remedied.

                    Failure to require age verification documents at the time of

                Of course, causes of violations can go beyond mere system
                failures, and can result from deliberate deception on the part
                of the supplier, management, certain employees and/or labor
                recruiters. Whether accidental or deliberate, violations should
                be remedied through a clear Corrective Action Plan that holds
                the supplier accountable.
            </p>

                Tables 1-4 describe some remediation actions that can be taken
                when indicators of forced labor are found. In all cases, issues
                should be documented and tracked and management systems should
                be updated to prevent recurrence.

                                determine whether the terms were reasonable. If

                                had knowledge of the arrangement. If so, work

                                Require the supplier to return all

                    Better Work encourages the development of democratic
                    industrial relations structures and processes by including
                    representatives of employers&rsquo; organizations and trade
                    unions in designing and implementing its programs. At the
                    factory level, compliance issues identified through
                    assessments are addressed by a Performance Improvement
                    Consultative Committee (PICC), a body of 8&ndash;10 persons
                    comprising an equal number of management and worker
                    representatives. Where possible, the formation and capacity
                    development of the PICC builds on a factory&rsquo;s existing
                    effective labor management structures. Each PICC meets at
                    least on a monthly basis. Supported by Better Work Advisors,
                    they formulate e and oversee implementation of a remediation
                    plan, ensuring that management and workers share
                    responsibility and accountability throughout the process.
                    Better Work Advisors are available to provide technical
                    assistance and conduct follow-up visits to evaluate progress
                    on the remediation plan.
