                <p>
                    Many people and organizations have roles in making your
                    social compliance system work, and each of these roles is
                    essential. The better everyone understands their roles and
                    responsibilities, the better the system will function.
                    Beyond training its own employees who have social compliance
                    responsibilities, a company should look to the following
                    parties across its supply chain:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your employees</li>
                    <li>Vendors or agents, if applicable</li>
                    <li>Suppliers at various tiers of your supply chain</li>
                    <li>
                        Labor brokers, recruiters and employment agencies, if
                        applicable
                    </li>
                    <li>Workers and trade unions</li>
                    <li>Communities and civil society groups</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </StaticData>
    );
};
