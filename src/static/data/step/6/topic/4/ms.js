                <h1>Where, When and How Should Training be Conducted?</h1>
                <p>
                    Some social compliance teams have in-house staff members who
                    develop training materials for their company&rsquo;s
                    program. Others contract out this function, or use training
                    materials developed by an industry or cross-industry group.
                    In some cases, it is also feasible and fruitful to engage
                    some stakeholder groups in training other stakeholder
                    groups. For example, vendors or agents can be trained, and
                    then be charged with training all the managers, supervisors
                    and human resources staff of the production facilities from
                    which they source. Trade unions can also play an important
                    role in developing training materials and raising awareness
                    among workers and/or communities on social compliance
                    issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Training for workers should be designed according to the
                    particular worker population. In a country or geographic
                    area where most workers have at least a basic education,
                    training may also be taught in a classroom setting using
                    written materials. However, there are industries and
                    geographic areas where a significant proportion of workers
                    may be illiterate or simply have very little experience in a
                    classroom. In such cases, training methods and materials
                    must be adapted to ensure that workers still capture the
                    necessary information. Specific training formats have been
                    developed for such populations, including films, graphical
                    materials, posters and other visuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In areas where many workers may lack basic education, some
                    companies choose to go beyond basic social compliance
                    training to offer literacy and numeracy education at the
                    worksite or scholarships for such education. These efforts
                    are often tied to the company&rsquo;s overall philanthropy
                    portfolio, discussed further in{" "}

                <p>
                    Cultural norms are also a key consideration in designing
                    trainings. For instance, in some countries, men and women
                    must be seated separately or separated by a certain distance
                    within a room. In some cases, a trainer of a certain gender
                    may be more appropriate for a particular group. Issues like
                    eye contact and personal space are important for trainers to
                    understand. It is also critical to have an understanding of
                    teaching styles that are common in the area &ndash; for
                    instance, in many cultures, raising one&rsquo;s hand to
                    answer a question or having a group &ldquo;brainstorm&rdquo;
                    is unheard of.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some companies also choose to tie their social compliance
                    training to other forms of training they may offer. In fact,
                    many companies have found that integrating social compliance
                    training into trainings on other topics like productivity,
                    quality assurance and industry-specific technical skills has
                    many benefits. Workers with improved skills are likely to be
                    valued more highly and treated better, and improved
                    workforce technical skills and productivity have concrete
                    impacts on producers and suppliers&rsquo; incomes, so the
                    trainings may be deemed more important by management and
                    supervisors.

                        </a>
                        . CocoaAction represents a voluntary industry
                        initiative, based on the vision of promoting a
                        sustainable and socially responsible cocoa supply chain
                        that offers a profitable way of life for cocoa farmers
                        and their families and provides significantly improved
                        quality of life for cocoa-growing communities.
                        CocoaAction member companies have committed to sharing
                        and exchanging information and best practices for
                        activities under CocoaAction. They have also dedicated
                        funding to implement the same agreed-upon, core
                        interventions. In addition, CocoaAction companies have
                        agreed to a finalized common results measurement
                        framework and key performance indicators, which will
                        allow them to measure progress and support learning
                        related to the overall strategy.

                    <p>
                        The core interventions under CocoaAction fall within two
                        packages: productivity and community development. The
                        productivity package is intended to help increase cocoa
                        yields and farmer income, with one intended outcome
                        being to help the farmers send their children to school
                        and thereby reduce exploitative child labor. The
                        community development package prioritizes activities
                        around child labor alleviation, primary education, and
                        women&rsquo;s empowerment. Under CocoaAction, companies
                        aim to strengthen Child Protection Committees with the
                        goal of expanding awareness of the importance of child
                        protection and the reduction of child labor. In
                        addition, through the strengthening of School Management
                        Committees, member companies aim to improve the capacity
                        of schools and communities to increase the number of
                        effectively functioning primary schools. Finally,
                        through the provision of skills training and income
                        generating activities, CocoaAction aims to increase the
                        capability, opportunity, and influence of women in cocoa
                        growing communities. Women&rsquo;s empowerment can have
                        a positive impact on reducing child labor as was seen in
                        one cocoa growing community where, through income
                        generating activities supported by a CocoaAction
                        company, women of the community raised funds for the
                        rehabilitation of classrooms.

                    <p>
                        These core interventions are paired with the
                        establishment of Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation
                        Systems across supply chains and within communities,
                        with the ultimate goal of significantly reducing child
                        labor in cocoa growing communities of C&ocirc;te
                        d&rsquo;Ivoire and Ghana.

                    respect for the ILO&rsquo;s international labor standards
                    and improving working conditions. SCORE provides

                    industry associations and trade unions, and other

                    Developing materials, scheduling training sessions, hiring
                    trainers and tracking training delivery are all significant
                    investments. There are various ways to structure financing
                    for your training program. Some companies simply choose to
                    allocate a large portion of their social compliance budget
                    to training and capacity building, believing that training
                    helps to prevent problems and ultimately saves money. Some
                    companies provide a core set of trainings free of charge,
                    but if code violations are found for which training is
                    required as part of remediation, the supplier then pays
                    those training costs. In some relationships, the
                    vendors/agents or suppliers handle all responsibilities
                    related to training, including all costs.
