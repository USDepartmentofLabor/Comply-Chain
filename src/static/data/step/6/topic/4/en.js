            <h1>Communication About Remediation</h1>
            <p>
                Particularly in cases where a complaint was received, leading to
                an audit and finding of violations, the submitter of the
                complaint&mdash;and possibly other stakeholders&mdash;will
                expect to know how the issue was handled. Your communication and
                public reporting should incorporate information about
                remediation to the extent possible. All such communication
                should ensure maximum protection for victims&rsquo; safety and
                privacy.
