                <h1>Where, When and How Should Training be Conducted?</h1>
                <p>Some social compliance teams have in-house staff members who develop training materials for their company&rsquo;s program. Others contract out this function or use training materials developed by an industry or cross-industry group. In some cases, it is also feasible and fruitful to engage some stakeholder groups in training other stakeholder groups. For example, vendors or agents can be trained and then charged with training all the managers, supervisors, and human resources staff of the production facilities from which they source. Trade unions can also play an important role in developing training materials and raising awareness among workers or communities on social compliance issues.</p>
                <p>Training for workers should be designed according to the worker population. In a country or geographic area where most workers have at least a basic education, training may also occur in a classroom setting using written materials. However, there are industries and geographic areas where a significant proportion of workers may be illiterate or simply have very little experience in a classroom environment. In such cases, training methods and materials must be adapted with different formats including films, graphical materials, posters, and other visuals.</p>
                <p>In areas where many workers may lack basic education, some companies choose to go beyond basic social compliance training to offer literacy and numeracy education at the worksite or scholarships for such education. These efforts are often tied to the company&rsquo;s overall philanthropy portfolio, discussed further in <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ilab/complychain/steps/2">Assessing and Addressing Root Causes</a>.</p>
                <p>Cultural norms are also a key consideration in designing trainings. For instance, in some countries, men and women must be seated separately or separated by a certain distance within a room. In some cases, a trainer of a certain gender may be more appropriate for a particular group. Issues like eye contact and personal space are important for trainers to understand, as is an understanding of teaching styles that are common in the area and those that are not common or accepted.</p>
                <p>Some companies also choose to tie their social compliance training to other forms of training they offer. In fact, many companies have found that integrating social compliance training into trainings on other topics like productivity, quality assurance, and industry-specific technical skills has many benefits. Workers with improved skills are likely to be valued more highly and treated better, and improved workforce technical skills and productivity have concrete impacts on producers&rsquo; and suppliers&rsquo; incomes, so the trainings may be deemed more important by management and supervisors. As with other forms of training, companies should monitor social compliance training progress and measure outcomes where possible.</p>
                <p>Developing materials, scheduling training sessions, hiring trainers, and tracking training delivery are all significant investments. There are various ways to structure financing for your training program. Some companies simply choose to allocate a large portion of their social compliance budget to training and capacity-building, believing that training helps to prevent problems and ultimately saves money. Some companies provide a core set of trainings free of charge, but if code violations are found for which training is required as part of remediation, the supplier then pays those training costs. In some relationships, the vendors, agents, or suppliers handle the responsibilities related to training, including all costs.</p>

                    <p>The ILO&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ilo.org/empent/Projects/score/lang--en/index.htm">SCORE program is</a> a training program designed to increase the productivity of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) while promoting recognition of and respect for the ILO&rsquo;s international labor standards and improving working conditions. SCORE provides &ldquo;training of trainers&rdquo; for government agencies, industry associations and trade unions, and other organizations, who then deliver the training program to SMEs. SCORE is currently active in emerging economies throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and as of July 2019, more than 2,100 SMEs have received SCORE training in 11 countries, representing a total workforce of more than 403,000 people.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Over the past decade, the chocolate and cocoa industry funded the construction and rehabilitation of schools and provision of school supplies and other education support services in hundreds of communities in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and Ghana. In addition to implementing child labor awareness-raising activities, industry stakeholders supported child labor data collection and monitoring through community- and supply chain-based child labor monitoring and remediation systems, including an ILO-IPEC project that developed and expanded community-based child labor monitoring systems. Recently, chocolate and cocoa companies and initiatives have moved past child labor monitoring systems to child labor monitoring and remediation systems (CLMRS), a system developed by the International Cocoa Initiative* and Nestl&eacute;*. Industry supported activities to increase the incomes of households with at-risk children and provided supplementary funding to the International Cocoa Initiative to expand its work to implement community action plans, train community child protection committees, and build classrooms.
