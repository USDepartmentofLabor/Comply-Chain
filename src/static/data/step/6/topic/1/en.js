                    Over the past two decades, many companies have discovered
                    through experience that auditing workplaces and remediating
                    violations alone does not solve many of the labor problems
                    found at production sites. Training, capacity building and
                    an emphasis on continuous improvement have been found to be
                    the most effective way to make progress toward greater
                    compliance with codes of conduct. Developing long-term
                    relationships with suppliers as well as with other key
                    stakeholders, is the best foundation for this kind of
                    capacity building and continuous improvement.

                    Various forms of communication with stakeholders are
                    discussed throughout all the sections of this app. This
                    section focuses on two specific forms of communication:{" "}
                    <strong>training and capacity building</strong>, both of
                    which you should provide to all parties responsible for
                    making your social compliance system work, including
                    entities in your supply chains. It also addresses options
                    for <strong>grievance mechanisms </strong>through which
                    workers, advocates and communities can bring human rights
                    issues to your attention without fear of reprisal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In beginning discussions on these issues, it is important to
                  explore the variety of entry points for starting conversations
                  along the supply chain.  ILAB found that occupational safety and
                  health (OSH) is a good entry point for companies to start engaging their
                  suppliers on issues of human rights and acceptable conditions of work.
                  After analyzing ILAB’s program evaluations of projects focused on reducing
                  child labor and forced labor in supply chains, partly through engagement
                  with employers, ILAB concluded that OSH is viewed as a non-contentious,
                  technical topic as stakeholders see improvements that benefit both employers and workers.
