            <h1>Improving Victim Situations</h1>
            <p>
                Audit teams must be prepared to encounter a broad range of
                situations with respect to child or forced labor in the
                workplace, from individualized cases to situations involving
                systemic and egregious abuse. Prior to the audit, auditors
                should prepare themselves with knowledge of local resources,
                including law enforcement and organizations that provide victim
                services. Companies that have gathered this type of data as part
                of their risk assessments and communication efforts, and
                captured it in their information systems, are best equipped to
                prepare auditors by providing this information in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a guiding principle, auditors&rsquo; immediate actions and
                the ongoing corrective actions taken by management should focus
                on what is best for the victims in question. Cases of egregious
                abuse that contravene local law should be reported to local law
                enforcement authorities, but this should be done in a manner
                that ensures the safety and well-being of the victims. Below is
                general guidance for actions that can be taken in response to
                various findings of child labor and forced labor.
            </p>
            <h2>Child Labor</h2>
            <h3>Underage Labor.</h3>
            <p>
                If the audit identifies a child in the workplace who is under
                the country&rsquo;s legal working age, the child should be
                removed from work immediately. If the audit identifies a child
                who is of legal age to work in the country, the appropriate
                immediate response depends on the company&rsquo;s code of
                conduct. If the company has set a minimum age that is higher
                than the legal minimum, the child should be removed from work
                immediately if he or she is below that age.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it is critical to keep in mind the possible
                consequences for the child. The child and his or her family will
                lose income, and unless it is replaced, the child may simply
                find a different job, potentially under worse conditions for the
                child&rsquo;s health, safety or well-being. Companies can take
                steps to mitigate this situation by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Providing a stipend to the child&rsquo;s family to make up
                    for the lost income, if the child&rsquo;s family can be
                    contacted;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Offering the child&rsquo;s job to another member of the
                    family who is of legal age to work;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Providing alternative income generation opportunities to the
                    child&rsquo;s parents or adult relatives;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensuring that the child attends school or an alternative
                    educational facility, paying associated fees as needed and
                    tracking the child until he or she is of age to work;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Providing the child a training or apprenticeship opportunity
                    when he or she is of legal age for such programs, and
                    committing to provide the job back once he or she is of full
                    legal working age;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Linking the child to educational, developmental,
                    psycho-social and other services provided by the government
                    or non-governmental organizations (NGOs); and
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the child has been living away from his or her family,
                    reuniting the child with the family while ensuring that it
                    can provide a protective environment, and provide the
                    applicable services.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hazardous Child Labor</h3>
            <p>
                No child under age 18 should be involved in the Worst Forms of
                Child Labor specified in ILO Convention 182 (see
                <Link to="/steps/3">Step 3, Develop a Code of Conduct</Link>). If
                children are found in such situations, the best approaches
                include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Eliminating any dangerous work activities from the
                    child&rsquo;s job, and closely monitoring the child&rsquo;s
                    work activities on an ongoing basis;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Helping the child identify other safe income-earning
                    opportunities, if there is no feasible way to reduce hazards
                    in his or her current work environment;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensuring that the child is not working too many hours or at
                    times that endanger his or her health, well-being or
                    education;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finding a way for the child to make up for the lost income
                    through other earning opportunities, a stipend or family
                    interventions, in the event working hours are reduced; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Linking the child to educational, developmental,
                    psycho-social and other services provided by the government
                    or NGOs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These activities are resource intensive. The relationships you
                have worked hard to build are vital at this stage, helping you
                to find resources and expertise available in the community. Of
                course, there are communities with very few resources and
                educational institutions. Options for action in such cases are
                discussed in <em>Addressing Root Causes</em>.

                    </strong>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Since 2011, the U.S.-based Fair Labor Association (FLA) has
                    been assessing working conditions on hazelnut farms in the
                    Black Sea region of Turkey, first as a special project
                    commissioned by the multinational corporation
                    Nestl&eacute;*, and later as a collaboration between the
                    FLA, Nestl&eacute; and two of its Turkey-based hazelnut
                    suppliers, Balsu Gida* and Olam Progida*. Annually, the FLA
                    sends a team of assessors to visit a sample of farms
                    supplying hazelnuts to these companies. The presence of
                    child labor has been a consistent finding, both among local
                    workers&rsquo; families, and among the groups of migrant
                    workers who travel to the region for the hazelnut harvest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The companies have pursued a number of remediation
                    strategies in response to these findings, such as civil
                    society partnerships to build schools and provide
                    scholarships for children of migrant workers and in hazelnut
                    communities. Further interventions have included training
                    for farmers on child labor prohibitions, and the provision
                    of age-verification tools to encourage farmers to document
                    the ages of their hired workers.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    In November 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor awarded the
                    FLA a grant to pilot-test a comprehensive, sustainable
                    program that implements all elements of the U.S. Department
                    of Agriculture (USDA) &ldquo;

                    began in 2016, and in 2018 the project will publish a report
                    detailing lessons learned from this pilot-test and
                    recommendations for other companies seeking to establish
                    programs based on these Guidelines.

            <h2>Forced Labor/Trafficking in Persons</h2>
            <p>
                If the audit identifies forced labor/trafficking victims,
                responses can vary depending on the type and circumstances of
                the victim&rsquo;s situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If auditors encounter, or if there are any reports of, egregious
                situations of forced labor/trafficking, such as worker
                confinement or physical or psychological abuse, these situations
                should be reported to law enforcement authorities. It is
                incumbent upon auditors, and other members of your social
                compliance team who may visit worksites, to be aware ahead of
                time of the appropriate law enforcement contacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, it is important to understand local law
                enforcement contexts. In environments where law enforcement
                officials may not be fully trained in handling egregious cases
                of abuse, auditors and other personnel should also be aware of
                victim services that are available&mdash;including healthcare,
                counseling, shelter, legal aid and other services&mdash;and be
                prepared to refer victims to such services.

                Debt bondage or other forms of financial entrapment are
                indicators of forced labor/trafficking, and also require a
                careful examination of all circumstances to determine the
                appropriate response. If it is found that workers are indebted
                because the supplier has been charging unreasonable costs for
                lodging, food or other expenses, the company should require that
                the supplier nullify the debt or reduce it to an amount that is
                reasonable for the goods and services provided. The situation
                becomes more egregious if the supplier has charged workers
                interest on these debts, and in such cases you will need to give
                serious consideration to the supplier&rsquo;s overall commitment
                to your social compliance requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it is found that workers owe debts to a recruiter or labor
                broker, further investigation may be necessary to determine
                whether the supplier was aware that the broker had charged these
                fees, or did not have a policy in place prohibiting brokers from
                charging fees. If the supplier was aware, or did not have a
                policy in place to actively deter such practices, the supplier
                should be held financially responsible for repaying fees to the
                workers. If the supplier was actively engaged in discouraging
                its brokers from charging workers a fee, and the broker did so
                but concealed this practice from the supplier, a company may
                consider taking steps to obtain reimbursement from the broker,
                or may simply choose to pay the fees to workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Audits may also uncover situations in which workers are forced
                to work overtime, with or without legal overtime pay. Regardless
                of pay, if workers are made to work long hours (beyond legal
                limits in the country) under the threat of penalty, this is a
                situation of forced labor. Remediation of these situations
                requires careful consideration, including with respect to how
                your own practices have affected the situation. Quick
                turn-around times and last-minute changes in specifications on
                the part of buyers frequently lead to situations of mandatory
                overtime. Companies should encourage suppliers to be honest if
                that cannot complete an order without violating the terms of the
                code of conduct, and companies should reward them rather than
                simply moving their business to another supplier. Refer to
                training for a company&rsquo;s employees for more information on
                avoiding these situations.
