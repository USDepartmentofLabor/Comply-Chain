                <h1>Communicating, Not Policing</h1>
                <p>Over the past two decades, many companies have discovered through experience that auditing workplaces and remediating violations alone does not solve many of the labor problems found at production sites. Training, capacity-building, and an emphasis on continuous improvement have been found to be the most effective ways to make progress toward greater compliance with codes of conduct. Developing long-term relationships with suppliers and other key stakeholders is the best foundation for this kind of capacity-building and continuous improvement.</p>
                <p>This section focuses on two specific forms of communication: <strong>training and capacity-building</strong>, both of which you should provide to all parties responsible for making your social compliance system work, including entities in your supply chains. See Step 5: Grievance Mechanisms to learn more about options for <strong>grievance mechanisms </strong>through which workers, advocates, and communities can bring human rights issues to your attention without fear of reprisal.</p>
                <p>In beginning discussions on these issues, it is important to explore the variety of entry points for starting conversations along the supply chain. ILAB found that occupational safety and health (OSH) is a good entry point for companies to start engaging their suppliers on issues of human rights and acceptable conditions of work. After analyzing ILAB&rsquo;s program evaluations of projects focused on reducing child labor and forced labor in supply chains, partly through engagement with employers, ILAB concluded that OSH is viewed as a non-contentious, technical topic as stakeholders see improvements that benefit both employers and workers.</p>
                <p>For example, in Mexico, the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/campos-de-esperanza-fields-hope">Campos de Esperanza</a> project implemented by World Vision* found that representatives from sugarcane associations and employer associations at the local and national levels had expressed a clear need for cost-benefit data to support the actualization of workplace improvements. Even without this information, however, the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/MexicoCdE_meval.pdf">midterm evaluation</a> found that the national-level sugarcane sector played a key role in supporting the project&rsquo;s OSH promoters in the sugar mills as a first step toward improving workplace conditions.<br /><br /></p>

                    </strong>
                </h2>
                <p>Since 2001, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), a large U.S. multinational information technology company, has sought to retain a stable, high-quality supply chain with trusted partners through its Supply Chain Responsibility programSupply Chain Responsibility program. From an overall approach, HPE&rsquo;s program looks to protect and elevate workers, reduce global and community environmental impact, and benefit HPE, HPE&rsquo;s business partners, and HPE&rsquo;s customers through a guided approach to assessing risks, monitoring and improving performance, and working collaboratively with suppliers, peers, and internal and external stakeholders to share knowledge on key issues.</p>
                <p>As part of HPE&rsquo;s Supply Chain Responsibility program, HPE works with suppliers in a four-phase process to develop Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) requirements that apply to any supplier doing business with HPE. The four phases provide a framework for supplier engagement as part of the Supply Chain Responsibility program. The initial phase (Assessment) encompasses a preliminary risk assessment, onboarding, and integration of SER requirements into the contract between HPE and the supplier. The second phase (Positioning for Engagement) entails a supplier self-assessment questionnaire shared with HPE, as well as a review of the supplier self-assessment questionnaire and ranking of risks, sometimes in conjunction with an audit. The third phase (Monitoring, Remediation, and Improvement) addresses onsite audits and assessments, corrective actions, and follow-up audits (if required), as well as independent NGO assessments, scorecards, and collaboration on remedy. Finally, the fourth phase (Capacity-Building) covers needs identification in addition to supplier capacity-building to enhance skills, toolset, management systems, and worker voice. This structured approach to engagement with suppliers represents one way that brands may organize their efforts to facilitate work with suppliers.</p>
                <p><br />To learn more about HPE&rsquo;s broader effort to share knowledge with stakeholders, as well as note progress towards supply chain goals and other forward statements, see HPE&rsquo;s annual <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/living-progress/report.html">Living Progress Report</a>, which provides an overview of HPE&rsquo;s approach, programs, and progress on the most salient Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues to HPE.</p>
