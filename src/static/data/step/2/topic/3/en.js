                <h1>Defining the Scope of Your Social Compliance System </h1>
                <p>
                                    Today, around the world there are roughly
                                    80,000 transnational enterprises and ten
                                    times as many subsidiaries. Most U.S.
                                    companies doing business globally contract
                                    with vendors, agents and/or producers abroad
                                    rather than owning production facilities
                                    overseas. Moreover, few companies market or
                                    sell a single product line, and many deal in
                                    hundreds if not thousands of products.
                                    Companies&rsquo; supply chains are long and
                                    complex, with a large number of links from
                                    their immediate suppliers back to the farms
                                    or mines where raw materials are sourced.
                                </p>

                                    For most companies, a social compliance
                                    system that enables oversight and control
                                    over every actor in every supply chain may
                                    be challenging. At the same time, it is
                                    fundamentally important that your company
                                    not only avoids causing or contributing to
                                    child and forced labor though its own
                                    activities, but also seek to prevent or
                                    mitigate adverse labor rights impacts linked
                                    to its business operations through business

                                    Ideally, a company&rsquo;s compliance system
                                    should be designed to prioritize those areas
                                    of the supply chain where the risk of
                                    egregious labor abuses is most significant,
                                    whether due to the operating context, the
                                    products or services involved, or other
                                    relevant considerations. By necessity, you
                                    may also need to prioritize those areas of
                                    the supply chain where the company has the
                                    greatest leverage to effect meaningful

                                    As noted below, the most recent guidance from
                                    international institutions has directly
                                    addressed the issue of supply chain
                                    responsibility&mdash;clarifying that
                                    companies must take responsibility for human
                                    and labor rights abuses in their supply
                                    chains. Specific responsibilities may vary
                                    depending on the severity of problems in the
                                    supply chain, the extent to which the
                                    company is directly causing or contributing
                                    to a problem, the company&rsquo;s leverage
                                    to influence supplier behavior, the nature
                                    of the business relationship between the
                                    company and the supplier in question, size
