            <p>
                Risk and impact assessments are fundamental elements of the due
                diligence process. They help identify ways in which you may be
                causing or contributing to labor rights abuses, as well as areas
                where you might be at risk of doing so. Assessments can help
                identify both existing child labor and forced labor in your
                supply chains, or risks of where in the supply chain these
                abuses may occur. This allows you to immediately take steps to
                mitigate or remediate existing problems, or to target your
                social compliance efforts to those areas of the supply chain
                with the greatest risks.{" "}
