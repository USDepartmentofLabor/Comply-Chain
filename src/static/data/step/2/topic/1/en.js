                <h1>Model of a Social Compliance System</h1>
                                <p>
                                While systems may vary from industry to industry, a good social compliance system in any industry includes multiple components, functioning in an integrated way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Although the steps below are numbered for
                                    ease of understanding, social compliance is
                                    an iterative and ongoing process. Companies
                                    may choose to proceed through these steps in
                                    a different order, and typically should not
                                    expect to complete one step before
                                    undertaking another. At the same time, a
                                    system without all components―for example,
                                    an auditing system that operates in
                                    isolation from communication and training,
                                    remediation and other measures―is very
                                    likely not to be sufficient to address
                                    challenging labor issues that can arise in
                                    global supply chains.

                                    forced labor―as well as other labor
                                    standards such as occupational safety and
                                    health, wages and hours of work (see{" "}
