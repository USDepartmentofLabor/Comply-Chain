                <h1>The Social Compliance Team</h1>
                <p>
                                In multinational companies, the social
                                compliance team is typically comprised of both a
                                management team, based at headquarters, and a
                                field team, based in countries from which
                                products are sourced, while SME&rsquo;s
                                typically have smaller social compliance teams.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Corporate structures vary widely, but a social
                                compliance team is often part of a larger
                                corporate social responsibility (CSR) or
                                sustainability department within the company.
                                The hallmark of the most successful social
                                compliance/CSR teams is that they have a direct
                                line of communication with high-level decision
                                makers, including the CEO and Board of
                                Directors. In addition, the social
                                compliance/CSR function must be well-integrated
                                with other components of the company,
                                particularly in areas such as supply chain
                                management, product development and sourcing.
                                For example, Nike Corporation&rsquo;s social
                                compliance function sits within its &ldquo;

                                &rdquo;, which is responsible for not only
                                environmental and social compliance but also
                                product development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The social compliance management team oversees
                                the entire social compliance system. It plans
                                activities, monitors implementation and receives
                                and analyzes reports from the field. Ideally,
                                the team is also empowered to make decisions on
                                individual situations and on the system as a
                                whole. Aside from core management skills such as
                                budgeting and data analysis, the management team
                                should include members who have the flexibility
                                to deal with unexpected situations, who can
                                motivate and support the field team and who can
                                advocate on behalf of the system to senior
                                management. Management team members should also
                                have some field exposure. They should shadow
                                audits, speak with workers and the labor unions
                                that represent them, both at the workplace and
                                outside it, and experience for themselves the
                                reality of workplaces from which products are
                                sourced.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The social compliance management team should
                                also be positioned for long-term continuity. In
                                companies where social compliance is segregated
                                from other business functions, the departure of
                                one or two key members of the team can damage
                                the entire social compliance program. It is
                                important, therefore, that the team build
                                capacity across a spectrum of staff members, so
                                operations can survive changes in personnel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, the management team must have resources
                                adequate to do its job. Above all, the
                                allocation of resources from senior management,
                                as well as performance incentive structures that
                                reward employees for social compliance
                                innovation, initiative and impact, are signals
                                that social compliance matters to the company.

                                Compliance field teams consist of the social
                                auditors who carry out social audits in
                                production facilities and work with factory
                                management to identify appropriate remediation
