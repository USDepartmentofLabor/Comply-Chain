                <p>
                    The media is playing an increasingly important role in
                    raising awareness among businesses, consumers, and the
                    general public about child labor and forced labor. In recent
                    years, many respected media outlets have generated headlines
                    with their reporting on these issues, including on child
                    labor and debt bondage in the production of Mexican
                    agricultural produce, brutal forced labor on fishing vessels
                    throughout Southeast Asia, bonded labor in India&rsquo;s
                    brick kilns, and fraudulent recruitment practices in
                    construction work in the Middle East, among many others. In
                    many cases, journalists&rsquo; key sources are
                    representatives of civil society organizations who have long
                    fought to bring these issues into the spotlight, and are now
                    finding greater opportunities to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this research and reporting, we know more about
                    the indigenous families who migrate through Central America
                    harvesting crops, including the elderly and very young
                    children. We understand better the kinds of government laws
                    and policies, such as those seen in some Gulf countries,
                    that can perpetuate forced labor by leaving migrant workers
                    vulnerable to exploitative practices such as passport
                    confiscation by their employers, non-payment of wages, and
                    contract substitution without the worker&rsquo;s consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are learning about the deep linkages between forced labor
                    and environmental destruction. In areas where goods are
                    produced illegally or where law enforcement is weak, both
                    people and the environment are at risk &ndash; as in gold
                    mining, an industry with high levels of illicit production,
                    known to contaminate drinking water and land with mercury
                    and cyanide, and where child labor seems to proliferate. We
                    have come to know the bleak stories behind the jubilance of
                    mega-sporting events: stories of workers deceived and paid a
                    pittance to construct awe-inspiring stadiums and toiling in
                    sweatshops to make apparel and merchandise for these events.
                    And we share in the collective abhorrence of the
                    exploitation of fishermen at sea.

                    Whether by shedding a light on opaque tiers of supply chains
                    to increase ethical recruitment and transparent sourcing, or
                    by spurring action to ensure that grievance and remediation
                    mechanisms exist to address labor violations, media coverage
                    can play an important role in contributing to
                    businesses&rsquo; due diligence efforts to prevent and
                    eliminate human rights violations in their supply chains.

                <p>
                    Child labor and forced labor are used to catch and process
                    fish and seafood in a range of aquatic environments around
                    the world. The isolated nature of work on waters presents a
                    number of challenges to child labor and forced labor law
                    enforcement in fishing and seafood. The{" "}

                    </a>{" "}
                    is the leading international instrument on the issue of
                    maritime law at sea. The Convention distinguishes between
                    different maritime areas&mdash;territorial sea, Exclusive
                    Economic Zones, and the high seas&mdash;and countries&rsquo;
                    ability to regulate activities within each of these. These
                    maritime boundaries add an additional layer of complexity to
                    enforcing labor laws on fishing vessels. The country with
                    its flag on a fishing vessel generally has the
                    responsibility for regulating labor conditions on that
                    vessel. However, when flagging states are unable or
                    unwilling to enforce labor laws on their vessels, workers
                    can become increasingly vulnerable to exploitation. While
                    ships may not change their flags during a voyage, vessels
                    have been known to use so-called flags of convenience, or
                    the flag of a state other than that of the vessel&rsquo;s
                    owner, to avoid financial or regulatory charges in that
                    state, as well as to subject themselves to a state&rsquo;s
                    labor regime they deem beneficial. Enforcement, prosecution,
                    and restitution efforts are further complicated when vessels
                    operate within the territorial jurisdiction of another
                    state.&nbsp;

                    Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing has
                    become an ever- growing problem. IUU fishing depletes global
                    seafood stocks and creates unfair competition within the
                    seafood industry, including by exploiting workers.
                    Governments have been increasing efforts related to IUU
                    fishing. For example, under its IUU regulation, the European
                    Union has issued pre-identifications, better known as
                    &ldquo;yellow cards&rdquo;, to countries that it deems are
                    not doing enough to combat IUU fishing. Issuance of a yellow
                    card initiates a formal dialogue with the government in
                    question regarding corrective measures. The U.S. government
                    is also taking action to address IUU fishing: a Presidential
                    Task Force on Combatting IUU Fishing released an{" "}

            <h2>Migrant Workers</h2>
            <p>
                Migrants are a category of workers particularly vulnerable to
                forced labor. In the global economy, millions of workers leave
                their homes for jobs elsewhere in their own country or in
                another part of the world. Many migrants in search of jobs place
                their trust in labor recruiters or brokers to make
                transportation arrangements and place them in jobs, but many
                workers find&mdash;too late&mdash;that their wages and
                employment terms do not match brokers&rsquo; promises. Some
                migrants incur large debts in the recruitment process, and
                become trapped in debt bondage when they cannot repay these
                debts. Cycles of debt bondage can also begin when employers
                deduct from workers&rsquo; wages for housing, food and other
                costs, leaving them with little or no take-home pay. Many
                migrant workers are required to sign contracts in languages they
                can&rsquo;t read; others have informal employment relationships
                with no contract at all. Some are required to turn over their
                identity documents to employers, leaving them without the option
                to escape abusive or exploitative conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your suppliers use labor brokers to recruit and place migrant
                labor, you may be at risk for forced labor and trafficking in
                your supply chains. Recommended resources on this issue include

                These include a comprehensive auditing system for all tobacco

                children&rsquo;s camps, vocational schools, community centers,
                schooling registration programs, and farm owner education and

                When audit reports are not available, there are other ways to
                gather information on your current suppliers to determine which
                ones to target for further compliance efforts. Wherever a union
                exists, it may be a good source of information on labor abuse
                risk factors. Where there is no union, the supplier may have
                other grievance or complaint mechanisms in place that could be a
                source of information. Another option, of course, is to survey
                all of your suppliers on the key risk factors listed above.
