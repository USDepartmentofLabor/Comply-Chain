                <h1>Using Risk and Impact Assessment Information </h1>
                <p>
                    Your social compliance team should have an information
                    system to manage all of its data. All mapping and risk and
                    impact assessment information should be entered
                    systematically into this system and updated on a periodic
                    basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost every risk and impact assessment exercise in any
                    industry will uncover some risks of labor abuses, and
                    possibly some adverse impacts you have already caused. You
                    will then be faced with decisions about what to do to
                    mitigate or remediate them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a risk and impact assessment reveals that a company is
                    directly contributing to or causing adverse impacts or risks
                    through its own sourcing or other practices, your first step
                    should be to remediate these impacts and tackle these issues
                    internally. As difficult as this process may be, you will
                    not be able to manage external risks effectively if you
                    cannot first manage internal ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your company is exploring sourcing from a new area, your
                    risk and impact assessment should reveal whether or not the
                    risks are too great. If there are substantial risks, this
                    merits strong consideration of whether your sourcing needs
                    can be met elsewhere. If the risks are ones you are willing
                    to take, your next step is to find suppliers that will
                    participate in your social compliance program and work with
                    you on continuous improvement. Those commitments should be
                    codified in your contracts with suppliers; many companies
                    require new suppliers to meet defined social compliance
                    benchmarks before they can sell to the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are sourcing from an area with high levels of
                    subcontracting, you may choose to limit how much production
                    your suppliers can subcontract to outside entities. This
                    limitation must then be included in contracts, and in turn
                    monitored and enforced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your risk and impact assessment focuses on your
                    established group of suppliers, your next steps will depend
                    on those suppliers&rsquo; performance. If egregious labor
                    abuses are taking place or are at risk of happening, you
                    should attempt to work with the suppliers to remediate the
                    abuses or improve their policies and processes. If a company
                    does not have sufficient leverage with a supplier to change
                    its behavior, you may attempt to increase your leverage by
                    collaborating with other buyers or by offering
                    capacity-building as an incentive. If the supplier does not
                    respond to these efforts, you should consider terminating
                    your sourcing relationship, while at the same time taking
                    into account the impacts on the workers of ending the
                    relationship and attempting to mitigate those impacts in the
                    process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some cases, a risk and impact assessment will identify a
                    specific underlying cause of labor abuses, and stakeholders
                    may also suggest ideas for mitigation.

                    In general, your responses to risk and impact assessment
                    information should center around the impact on workers. In
                    the early days of social compliance, companies that
                    identified egregious labor abuses or serious risks in their
                    supply chains tended to terminate sourcing immediately from
                    the suppliers in question. Such actions sent a strong
                    message to suppliers about compliance, but also had
                    devastating consequences for workers. The issue of
                    &ldquo;responsible disengagement&rdquo; from a supplier is
                    explored in SOMO&rsquo;s discussion paper,{" "}

                    . The growing consensus in social compliance is toward
                    capacity-building and development of long-term relationships
                    as a way to improve compliance, rather than immediate
                    termination because of the negative effects on workers. The
                    following example demonstrates this trend.

                        Mica is a mineral used in various industries, including
                        in the cosmetics industry, where it provides a
                        glittering effect in a range of products. While
                        L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al sources more than 60 percent of its
                        natural mica from the United States, the rest originates

                        implements a sustainable procurement program that works

                    Capacity-building and relationship-building usually entail
                    some company investment in training and support for
                    suppliers. However, many companies are adopting a model of
                    upfront investment in building capacity of vendors, agents
                    and suppliers, and then holding them responsible for social
                    compliance performance&mdash;a model that can prove
                    cost-effective over the long run. These and other training

                    When you invest in a risk and impact assessment and uncover
                    risks and mitigate them, do not forget to communicate about
                    these efforts. Stakeholders who contributed to the risk and
                    impact assessment deserve a &ldquo;feedback loop&rdquo; on
                    how their information was used. If you took action on
                    information that came from an existing complaint process or
                    mechanism, you should report on your actions. Information on
                    your risk and impact assessment and mitigation also belongs
                    in the company&rsquo;s public reports.

                <p>
                    Finally, risk and impact assessment activities should be
                    ongoing, and you should update mapping information regularly
                    in your information system. Social compliance risks change
                    over time as the environment evolves and a company&rsquo;s
                    operations change.
