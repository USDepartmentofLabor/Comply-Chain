                When planning or enhancing a social compliance system, it is
                important to understand the root causes of child labor and
                forced labor, as well as strategies for addressing such labor
                abuses. The links below can assist.

                products are increasingly sourced&mdash;or where major
                agricultural commodities are grown&mdash;have deeply entrenched
                social, economic and societal challenges that perpetuate child
                labor and forced labor.

                <strong>Poverty</strong>
                <br /> Based on 2005 estimates from the World Bank, 1.4 billion
                people in the developing world live in extreme poverty,
                surviving on less than $1.25 a day. During the global economic
                crisis, lack of adult employment with decent wages further
                exacerbated global poverty. Poverty carries vulnerabilities
                beyond low income. Individuals who are poor lack mechanisms to
                cope with economic shocks, and suffer disproportionately from
                poor health, hunger and inadequate access to education and
                services. As such, they may be more willing to assume risk to
                avail themselves of economic opportunities, making them more
                vulnerable to labor exploitation. This is particularly true for
                migrant workers, who may be at the mercy of recruiters and
                receiving employers.

                        Ineffective or inadequate government resources
                    </strong>
                    <br /> Many governments have not enacted strong laws against
                    labor abuse; others may have adequate laws but do not
                    enforce them effectively, or may struggle with inadequate
                    revenues to address social problems. In some countries,
                    government corruption, sometimes with corporate complicity,
                    and weak rule of law allow abusive practices to occur in
                    worksites and go unpunished. Many governments lack effective
                    social protections for their citizens, leaving workers who
                    may be abused without alternative livelihoods or support
                    services.

                    <strong>Lack of access to quality education</strong>
                    <br /> In many countries, citizens continue to face barriers
                    to adequate education. Lack of access may be driven by many
                    factors, including the absence of free public education;
                    requirements to pay for books, uniforms and other
                    necessities that prevent poor children from enrolling; an
                    inadequate education infrastructure; or poor quality
                    instruction. Children who have limited or nonexistent
                    educational opportunities are more likely to enter the
                    workforce. Individuals who are denied educational
                    opportunities in childhood face more restricted employment
                    opportunities as adults and are, therefore, more vulnerable
                    to exploitation.

                    </strong>
                    <br /> In many countries, trade unions, as well as human
                    rights and other civil society groups, are suppressed by the
                    government, sometimes with the support of employers. In some
                    cases, unions exist but have direct links to the government.
                    An absence of effective, independent trade unions hampers
                    collective bargaining and thus workers&rsquo; ability to
                    effectively advocate for their rights, including fair
                    compensation and safe working conditions.

                    In many countries, women face additional risks of labor
                    exploitation, including child labor and forced labor. For
                    example, women are often less educated than men of the same
                    socio-economic and cultural background, and social factors
                    may restrict their capacity to communicate with authority
                    figures. These types of inequalities can make women less
                    capable of speaking up to defend their rights as workers.

                    <strong>Conflict</strong>
                    <br /> According to World Bank statistics, more than 1.5
                    billion people live in countries affected by violent
                    conflict. Countries plagued by cycles of violence also
                    experience 20 percent higher poverty rates. Conflict is a
                    push factor for migration, as workers are often forced to
                    leave home to seek opportunity due to physical and economic
                    devastation, as well as insecurity.

                    Natural disasters and extreme weather, including drought and
                    flooding, are also push factors for migration. The Internal
                    Displacement Monitoring Center estimates that in 2010 alone,
                    approximately 42 million people worldwide were displaced by
                    natural disaster, with several parts of Asia especially
                    affected by high numbers of displaced persons.

                        <br />
                    </strong>
                    In many countries, workers may not have access to
                    information enabling them to understand what constitutes
                    child labor, forced labor or other labor abuses. Lack of
                    awareness about good labor practices and workers&rsquo;
                    rights can be compounded by language barriers, particularly
                    where multiple languages are spoken by workers within a
                    facility. This heightens individuals&rsquo; vulnerability to
                    exploitative labor and hinders their capacity to organize
                    and advocate for themselves.

                    Even companies with the best intentions face constraints in
                    administering an effective social compliance
                    program.&nbsp;For example, tight margins may tempt suppliers
                    to evade social compliance requirements. Managing a social
                    compliance program effectively requires continuous
                    examination of your own actions and a system for regularly
                    communicating messages to your supply chain.

                    from the formal to the informal economy and from permanent

                    informalization of formal economy jobs, where workers engage

                    workers not only do they receive fewer employer-provided

                    government supports, such as unemployment insurance and
                    social security, but they are likely to be more vulnerable

                The responsibility for protecting human rights rests with
                governments, both individually and working collectively in the
                international system. The Group of 20 (G-20) Labor and
                Employment Ministers have recognized decent work as a
                cornerstone for strong, sustainable and balanced growth and have
                encouraged governments to focus on strengthening social
                protection systems and improving active employment policies,
                particularly for youth and vulnerable groups.to Though
                governments must take the lead, business, civil society, labor
                unions and international organizations all have important roles
                in promoting and supporting such action. Corporations have a
                critical part to play in this effort, including in the following
                areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wages and benefits</strong>

                    </strong>
                    Through investment and job creation, you are already
                    contributing to economic growth and better livelihoods for
                    workers in the countries where you source.&nbsp;You are also
                    ensuring that your vendors are paying workers at least the
                    minimum wage of the country and complying with all
                    applicable laws or negotiated agreements in relation to
                    worker compensation, such as overtime, paid leave, and other
                    benefits. However, in some cases, the minimum wage may not
                    be enough to provide a decent livelihood for workers.
                    <br />
                    <br /> In some cases, the minimum wage may not be enough to
                    provide a decent livelihood for workers. In-work benefits to
                    supplement salaries can help enhance workers&rsquo; welfare
                    without a raise in the minimum wage. Some in-work benefits
                    for low-income workers are provided by governments in the
                    form of tax credits and reduced social security obligations.
                    Private companies can also provide benefits through
                    reimbursement of health care costs and provision of
                    transportation and child care. Productivity incentive-based
                    bonuses can also be a benefit&mdash;as long as they can
                    actually be met on a regular basis and inability to meet
                    them does not result in excessive hours of work or work
                    hours that are unpaid or paid below minimum wagenot paid in
                    accordance with legal requirements.

                    <strong>Business processes</strong>
                    <br /> Sometimes simple changes in processes can make a big
                    difference in workers&rsquo; day-to-day lives. For instance,
                    how and when workers are paid is critical for low-income
                    individuals. Reliable, consistent payment relieves a large
                    strain on workers who may have little or no savings to rely
                    upon and are put at risk when paid late or unpredictably.
                    Similarly, wWorkers who are paid on a piece rate basis
                    should fully understand the terms of their compensation.
                    Similarly, employers must ensure that workers fully
                    understand and accept any withholdings from earnings, such
                    as taxes or trade union dues.Continuous job training is also
                    an important way for companies to keep workers invested in
                    their positions while advancing business capacity and
                    productivity.

                    resources, you can have an impact&mdash;particularly if you
                    work together with other companies to negotiate agreements
                    with governments to invest in certain areas in exchange for
                    social services or other community benefits.&nbsp;Examples
                    may include supporting&nbsp;expert technical assistance for
                    government agencies to improve laws, enforcement, policies
                    and programs, or agreeing&nbsp;to fund a certain
                    initiative&mdash;such as building a school in a particular

            <p>
                Many gemstones&mdash;including 90 percent of the world&rsquo;s
                rubies&mdash;are mined in Burma, a country long ruled by a
                dictatorship widely known to perpetrate human rights abuses
                against its people, and still facing enormous governance and
                human rights challenges. Leber Jeweler Inc., a family-owned
                company based in Chicago, does not purchase any Burmese
                gemstones. In 2004, the company founded the Jewelers&rsquo;
                Burma Relief Project, which brings together like-minded
                companies with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as
                the Foundation for the People of Burma and Planet Care, to
                provide humanitarian aid to Burmese people of all ethnic
                backgrounds and religions. The project was also part of a
                lobbying effort that resulted in the U.S. Congress passing the
                Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, which bans the
                importation of all Burmese rubies and jade into the U.S.

                    <strong>Supporting labor unions</strong>
                    <br /> Your code of conduct should include the rights to
                    freedom of association and collective bargaining, but in any
                    given workplace there may or may not be a union present. In
                    workplaces where there is no independent union, it is
                    especially important for auditors to look for signs that
                    worker association may be suppressed. If this is then
                    identified, it should be dealt with in corrective action
                    plans. When a union is present, it is incumbent to include
                    union representatives in your communication and outreach
                    efforts. Ultimately, effective worker organization and
                    engagement are critical elements of any effort to identify
                    and deal with child labor, forced labor and other labor
                    abuses.

                    with schools but where education quality is low, you can
                    finance training for teachers or funding for better teacher
                    salaries.&nbsp;In communities where quality education is
                    available, you can finance a scholarship program. Vocational

                One hallmark of clothing produced in India is beautiful
                handwork&mdash;beading, embroidery and other embellishments.
                Apparel producers subcontract much of this handwork to
                India&rsquo;s &ldquo;embroidery belt,&rdquo; where the work is
                done in informal workshops or homes. Handwork is an important
                source of income in this region, particularly for women. Over
                the years, companies sourcing apparel from India have had
                difficulty tracking handwork subcontracting arrangements. To get
                a handle on this area of its supply chain, Gap Inc. formed a
                multi-stakeholder group with the Government of India, suppliers,
                a local training institute and a local NGO. The group designed a
                program involving 20,000 women who do handwork in their homes or
                at community centers. The women who work at home bring finished
                products to the community centers for pick-up, which increases
                efficiency for suppliers. The local NGO coordinates monitoring
                of working conditions as well as payment to the workers. Workers
                are also provided free training to upgrade their handwork
                skills.

            </p>
            <p>
                In the developing world, the majority of children who lack
                access to primary school are girls. To combat this gender
                inequality, Proctor and Gamble (P&amp;G) partnered with the
                United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organization
                (UNESCO) to create a cause-related marketing campaign for a
                literacy program for girls in several regions of Senegal. A
                percentage of profits from sales of P&amp;G&rsquo;s feminine
                hygiene products in France and Romania provide funding for the
                program. P&amp;G also contributed to the program with an
                up-front donation. The program focuses on educating girls and
                women because educating them can have numerous benefits on
                health, economic, and social conditions. In addition,
                P&amp;G&rsquo;s own Protecting Futures project uses the
                company&rsquo;s expertise in basic sanitary protection to help
                girls in the developing world. The project provides puberty
                education, sanitary protection, and sanitary facilities to
                prevent girls from missing several days of school each month due
                to inadequate resources for managing their menstrual cycles.

                    simultaneously improve quality of life and enhance workplace
                    productivity. Health programs may take the form of

                    for workers and their families. These efforts help improve

                <strong>In Their Own Words</strong>

                &ldquo;Ultimately, we strongly believe that higher standards
                will drive better performance and results in our
                suppliers&rsquo; factories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Five years ago, the Levi Strauss Foundation partnered with
                Business for Social Responsibility to launch HER-Project, a
                woman&rsquo;s health education program in factories in
                Bangladesh, China, Egypt, and Pakistan. The program is touching
                more than 90,000 women in 65 facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The focus is on women&rsquo;s health outcomes, helping factory
                workers connect to existing health care services nearby.
            </p>
            <p>
                A study found that for every dollar invested in building the
                capacity of factory health clinics, health education, and
                training, three dollars of return are realized in the form of
                increased productivity on the factory floor.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me repeat that &ndash; one dollar invested provides three
                dollars in return: Greater concentration on the shop floor. Less
                absenteeism. More production targets met. These are exactly the
                kinds of results socially responsible investors have told us we
                could achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workplaces of the 21st century will be stronger when workers
                have the tools to improve their lives. When they are given
                healthy and safe workplaces, they become more productive,
                dependable, and efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can demonstrate that investing in workers is what you do
                because, one: it&rsquo;s the right thing; and two: it yields
                profitable returns.&rdquo;

                    <strong>Financial literacy training.</strong> Low-income
                    workers may have little education with regard to handling
                    their finances.&nbsp;Providing training about basic
                    financial competencies can help workers improve their
                    financial sustainability.&nbsp;This may include training
                    workers on basic savings techniques or helping them
                    understand and access appropriate financial products.
                    <br />
                    <br /> It also makes sense to choose philanthropic
                    initiatives that have synergies with the products you sell
                    and the expertise of your company. For example, Hugo Boss, a
                    clothing retailer, markets a special scarf and donates $10
                    from the sale of each to a Save the Children project in
                    India&rsquo;s textile industry.

                    <strong>Developing markets</strong>. Many companies sourcing
                    products from the developing world have also begun marketing
                    and selling products in emerging markets. Economic growth in
                    some countries has created large new markets for consumer
                    products. Recent research has made the case for company
                    investment in education, health and livelihoods programs for
                    the poorest segment of these societies, the so-called
                    &ldquo;bottom of the pyramid,&rdquo; in order to encourage

                economic health of the society in which it was

                the rural communities in which it operates. Major
                accomplishments of the program include stimulating productivity
