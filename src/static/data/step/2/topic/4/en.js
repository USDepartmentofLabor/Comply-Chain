                                    Like any successful business unit, the
                                    social compliance management team should
                                    have management systems that are integrated
                                    into the overall systems of the company,
                                    rather than existing in a silo separate from
                                    other business operations. Many management
                                    system elements―such as risk assessment,
                                    communication plans, information systems,
                                    grievance and complaint mechanisms, and
                                    independent verification―are the subject of
                                    this app and are covered more
                                    comprehensively in different sections.

                                    Managing any system or program should start
                                    with setting goals, objectives and targets
                                    for performance. Many social compliance
                                    programs establish metrics, or Key
                                    Performance Indicators (KPIs), against which
                                    to measure progress. KPIs can be developed
                                    internally, or as part of a benchmarking
                                    exercise to compare against other
                                    companies&rsquo; programs. Once set, the
                                    team should periodically check progress
                                    against those targets or indicators, and
                                    address areas where they have not been met.
                                    The team should also periodically review its
                                    processes and policies and update them as
                                    needed. Companies with strong social

                                    At a practical level, the management team
                                    should ensure that it has documented all of

                                    system. This documentation should include
                                    written policies and procedures for all
                                    components of the system, as well as
