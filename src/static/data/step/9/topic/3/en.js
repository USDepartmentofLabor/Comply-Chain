                <p>
                    Some companies and social compliance initiatives have begun
                    to consider impact evaluation as a way to determine the
                    long-term development impact of their efforts to reduce
                    child labor, forced labor and other labor rights violations
                    in their supply chains. Impact evaluation is a method that
                    establishes, with statistical rigor, a causal linkage and
                    quantifiable impact of a specific intervention. Impact
                    evaluation isolates the effects of a program or service by
                    comparing a treatment group (those exposed to the program or
                    service) to an identical group that does not receive the
                    program or service.

                    <p>
                        A multidisciplinary academic team from Tufts University
                        and the ILO conducted a long-term impact evaluation of
                        the Better Work program from 2009 to 2015. The
                        methodology evaluated project outcomes beyond the
                        factory or industry level. In certain countries, the
                        study team used the methodology to look at both managers
                        and workers to assess human development and economic
                        development indicators. In other countries, impact
                        measurement analyzed year-to-year changes in factory
                        performance using a range of other qualitative research
                        methods.

                    <p>
                        The study presents evidence that improvements in
                        working&nbsp;conditions lead to higher productivity and
                        firm profitability. Key findings show that workers reach
                        daily production targets nearly 40 minutes faster in
                        factories with high rates of labor law compliance than
                        in factories with lower rates. In addition, the study
                        shows that when workers are concerned about verbal
                        abuse, it takes them almost one extra hour per day to
                        reach their production target.

                        It should be noted that, while review and assessment
                        methods like independent monitoring, independent
                        verification and impact evaluation can verify that
                        companies have robust systems in place to reduce the
                        likelihood of child labor, forced labor and other labor
                        abuses in supply chains, none of these methods
                        guarantees that these abuses are not present.
