                <h1>Independent Monitoring (Auditing)</h1>
                <p>
                    As discussed under{" "}
                    <Link to="/steps/7">Step 5, Monitor Compliance,</Link>{" "}
                    independent monitoring should consist of unannounced site
                    visits to worksites in the company&rsquo;s supply chain to
                    evaluate compliance with the code of conduct. Announced
                    visits may also be useful when it is necessary to have
                    access to specific personnel or documentation present. In
                    cases where the company&rsquo;s internal or paid third-party
                    auditors conduct audits on a sampling basis in high-risk
                    supply chain areas, the sites visited by independent
                    monitors can be the same as those already audited, or a
                    different sample of worksites in those areas, or both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Independent monitors should be impartial, accredited
                    individuals or organizations with expertise on labor
                    standards, appropriate language skills, and detailed
                    knowledge of local workplace conditions and prevailing
                    industry practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Independent monitors should provide the company with a
                    report outlining their findings, and may make
                    recommendations for remediation measures a company should
                    take to address any violations found. Companies should make
                    this report public, or include it in their broader public
                    reporting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In situations where accountability to institutional
                    structures does not exist, independent monitoring can
                    provide another option for credible monitoring results. And
                    if you are not able to secure independent monitoring as
                    described here, you can still maintain open channels of
                    communication with stakeholders who have access to worksites
                    and may detect labor abuses. Labor unions are viewed by some
                    as &ldquo;independent monitors&rdquo;&mdash;if a union is
                    present at the worksite, it should be aware of safe ways to
                    bring issues to your attention. Similarly, individual
                    workers and community groups may be aware of issues that are
                    not detected by auditors. Making available to the public a
                    list of the suppliers from whom a company sources can
                    provide such groups the opportunity to bring issues to a
                    company&rsquo;s attention.

                        responsible sugarcane production. In order to become

                        Body, must first meet several criteria, including the
                        following: 1) A Certification Body (CB) must be in
                        compliance with International Organization for
                        Standardization (ISO) 17065:2012{" "}

                        </em>
                        while audit personnel must follow the guidelines in ISO

                        <em> Guidelines for auditing management systems</em>; 2)
                        A (CB) must operate at least one accredited program that
                        meets the sustainability criteria of Bonsucro&rsquo;s
                        own Production Standard and Chain of Custody Standard;
                        and 3) A CB is responsible for staying up-to-date on
                        Bonsucro requirements and, if applicable, relevant EU
                        legislation. When a CB is approved by Bonsucro and signs
                        a contractual agreement, Bonsucro will issue official
                        approval and list the CB on the Bonsucro Website as an
                        official Bonsucro-approved CB. The CB may then be
                        utilized to conduct audits according to Bonsucro&rsquo;s
                        standards.
