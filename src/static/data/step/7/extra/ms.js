                    Social auditing is one of the key ways—in addition to
                    engagement with unions/workers and grievance mechanisms—to
                    obtain information about violations of a company’s code of
                    conduct in your supply chain. Auditing uncovers problems; it
                    does not solve problems. It is one piece of the larger
                    social compliance system, and cannot and should not be done
                    in isolation from stakeholder engagement, communication,
                    remediation and the other steps in the process.
