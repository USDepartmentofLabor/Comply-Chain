                <h1>Steps in an Audit</h1>
                <p>
                    An audit typically consists of several steps, listed
                    below.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Arrival at the worksite</h2>
                        <p>
                            Company practice varies in terms of whether
                            worksites are notified in advance of an audit (an
                            &ldquo;announced audit&rdquo;). However, best
                            practice in this area normally is{" "}
                            <strong>unannounced</strong> audits. No one at the
                            worksite should be notified in advance that the
                            audit team will visit on a particular day.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Opening meeting with management</h2>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of the opening meeting is to explain the
                            audit process to the worksite managers, including
                            the portions in which management is or is not
                            requested to participate. This is also the time for
                            the team to request the documentation needed for the
                            audit; management may need some time to assemble
                            those documents after the meeting.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Walk-through of the worksite</h2>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of the walk-through is to observe
                            conditions in the factory and any associated
                            locations such as cafeterias and dormitories. This
                            allows the audit team to get a sense of any
                            discernible social compliance concerns; for
                            instance, the auditors may observe workers that
                            appear young, possibly below the minimum age. The
                            team should observe, but not disrupt, the flow of
                            work in the factory. Auditors may choose to speak
                            with workers briefly, but not in a manner that would
                            interrupt their work or put the workers in any
                            jeopardy. The walk-through is also a good time to
                            examine safety equipment, emergency exits and
                            timekeeping systems.

                            a medical examination prior to employment may help
                            to indicate the person&rsquo;s true age and also to
                            verify the physical aptitude for the work. Care
                            should always be taken to respect the person&rsquo;s

                            required for work to obtain further information.

                            school enrolment certificates can be a good source

                        Local indicators may also be helpful in countries where
                        the challenge is that the worker may not know the
                        precise year in which he or she was born. For example,
                        in some Asian countries children do not know their
                        precise year of birth but they know the animal year
                        (Year of the Monkey, etc.). A person might know that
                        their birth is related to some major historical event,
                        such as independence or the start or end of a war, or a
                        significant anniversary. You may wish to check what are
                        some local key events or means of marking time in the
                        country of operation which you could use in interviews
                        with workers where you may have doubts about their age.

                        <p>
                            The team should select a cross-section of workers to
                            interview. The selected workers should represent the
                            full diversity of the workplace, and include (as
                            applicable) men and women, migrant workers and local
                            workers, workers on different shifts, workers
                            performing different tasks, members of various
                            production teams, etc. If there are young persons in
                            the facility, a representative group should be
                            interviewed using age-sensitive interview
                            techniques.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Interviews may be conducted individually or in
                            groups, and typically are conducted both inside and
                            outside the facility. Particularly in cases where
                            there are indications of egregious violations about
                            which employees may hesitate to discuss at work,
                            auditors may need to make time to speak with workers
                            outside work hours and away from the worksite.
                            Auditors should use their audit tools to ensure that
                            they ask workers a comprehensive set of questions.
                            They also should collect copies of paystubs from
                            workers in order to compare them to
                            management-provided payment records.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Interviews also provide workers a chance to voice
                            any other concerns they may have. Workers should be
                            ensured that all responses are confidential and are
                            never shared with management. Your contract with
                            suppliers should include a clause on non-retaliation
                            against workers for participating in an audit;
                            participation in an audit should carry the same
                            worker protections as any grievance mechanism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a trade union is present in the facility, a
                            representative should be interviewed. In the absence
                            of a trade union or other worker representative
                            organization, auditors should attempt to reach out
                            to local worker advocacy groups.

                            gathered through worker interviews. The team should

                            human resources personnel, production supervisors

                            For companies with significant numbers of migrant
                            and contract workers in their supply chains, there
                            is an increasing movement toward interviewing labor
                            recruiters and brokers as part of the audit process.
                            Gaining access to recruiters or brokers for
                            interviews can be a challenge, and is likely to
                            require the supplier&rsquo;s coordination and
                            cooperation. Verit&eacute;&rsquo;s{" "}

                        <p>
                            The closing meeting is a time to report to
                            management any code violations found in the
                            facility. Some companies use the closing meeting as
                            a time to request management proposals to remediate
                            problems or to work with management on a corrective
                            action plan (CAP). Other companies use the closing
                            meeting as a time to discuss issues with management,
                            but develop formal CAPs after the audit is complete
                            and the full team has reviewed the audit report.

                        <h2>Report preparation</h2>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            The length of an audit depends on the size of the
                            worksite. Most audits take one to two days, but they
                            can, and companies should invest in, longer audits
                            if the worksite and workforce are large and/or if
                            significant violations are found that require time
                            to investigate. Audits triggered by a grievance or
                            whistleblower complaint may take longer to
                            investigate, particularly if they require
                            intervention by law enforcement authorities.
