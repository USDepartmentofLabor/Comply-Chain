                <p>
                    An audit typically consists of several steps, listed
                    below.&nbsp;

                             Company practice varies in terms of whether
                             worksites are notified in advance of an audit (an
                             &ldquo;announced audit&rdquo;). However, best
                             practice in this area normally is{" "}
                             <strong>unannounced</strong> audits. No one at the
                             worksite should be notified in advance that the
                             audit team will visit on a particular day.

                               the portions in which management is or is not
                               requested to participate. This is also the time for
                               the team to request the documentation needed for the
                               audit; management may need some time to assemble
                               those documents after the meeting.

                             The purpose of the walk-through is to observe
                             conditions in the factory and any associated
                             locations such as cafeterias and dormitories. This
                             allows the audit team to get a sense of any
                             discernible social compliance concerns; for
                             instance, the auditors may observe workers that
                             appear young, possibly below the minimum age. The
                             team should observe, but not disrupt, the flow of
                             work in the factory. Auditors may choose to speak
                             with workers briefly, but not in a manner that would
                             interrupt their work or put the workers in any
                             jeopardy. The walk-through is also a good time to
                             examine safety equipment, emergency exits and
                             timekeeping systems.

                                     a medical examination prior to employment may help
                                     to indicate the person&rsquo;s true age and also to

                                 the challenge is that the worker may not know the
                                 precise year in which he or she was born. For example,
                                 in some Asian countries children do not know their
                                 precise year of birth but they know the animal year
                                 (Year of the Monkey, etc.). A person might know that
                                 their birth is related to some major historical event,
                                 such as independence or the start or end of a war, or a
                                 significant anniversary. You may wish to check what are
                                 some local key events or means of marking time in the
                                 country of operation which you could use in interviews
                                 with workers where you may have doubts about their age.

                             The team should select a cross-section of workers to
                             interview. The selected workers should represent the
                             full diversity of the workplace, and include (as
                             applicable) men and women, migrant workers and local
                             workers, workers on different shifts, workers
                             performing different tasks, members of various
                             production teams, etc. If there are young persons in
                             the facility, a representative group should be
                             interviewed using age-sensitive interview
                             techniques.&nbsp;

                             Interviews may be conducted individually or in
                             groups, and typically are conducted both inside and
                             outside the facility. Particularly in cases where
                             there are indications of egregious violations about
                             which employees may hesitate to discuss at work,
                             auditors may need to make time to speak with workers
                             outside work hours and away from the worksite.
                             Auditors should use their audit tools to ensure that
                             they ask workers a comprehensive set of questions.
                             They also should collect copies of paystubs from
                             workers in order to compare them to
                             management-provided payment records.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             Interviews also provide workers a chance to voice
                             any other concerns they may have. Workers should be
                             assured that all responses are confidential and are
                             never shared with management. Your contract with
                             suppliers should include a clause on non-retaliation

                                            The closing meeting is a time to report to
                                            management any code violations found in the
                                            facility. Some companies use the closing meeting as
                                            a time to request management proposals to remediate
                                            problems or to work with management on a corrective
                                            action plan (CAP). Other companies use the closing
                                            meeting as a time to discuss issues with management,
                                            but develop formal CAPs after the audit is complete
                                            and the full team has reviewed the audit report.

                                             The length of an audit depends on the size of the
                                             worksite. Most audits take one to two days, but they
                                             can, and companies should invest in, longer audits
                                             if the worksite and workforce are large and/or if
                                             significant violations are found that require time
                                             to investigate. Audits triggered by a grievance or
                                             whistleblower complaint may take longer to
                                             investigate, particularly if they require
                                             intervention by law enforcement authorities.
