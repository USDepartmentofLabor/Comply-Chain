                </h1>
                <p>In many countries, particularly developing countries, the informal economy accounts for a significant portion of the overall economy. A large proportion of agricultural work is informal, and in the manufacturing sector, portions of production are frequently subcontracted to informal workshops or homes.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Child labor and forced labor typically thrive in the informal economy&mdash;in unregistered workplaces outside the purview of labor unions, labor inspectors, and law enforcement. Using child labor in the home increases a family unit&rsquo;s productivity and wages with little risk of interference from regulatory bodies. In addition, the increased focus by many governments and corporations on eradicating child labor may have caused more of it to be driven underground into informal work. The informal economy often involves the most dangerous and hidden forms of work, and children are extremely vulnerable to the negative impacts of the work associated with informal labor situations.<br /><br /></p>

                        <strong>Example in Action</strong>: Challenges of informal work
                    </h4>
                    <p>Companies and multi-stakeholder groups have been grappling with the challenges of informal work and homework for years. In 2010, the Ethical Trading Initiative* published <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.ethicaltrade.org/resources/homeworker-project-resource-downloads">ETI Homeworker Guidelines</a><em> for both retailers and suppliers</em>. These guidelines and their supporting documents include tools such as a model policy for retailers and suppliers on homework, research guides for identifying homework in supply chains, mapping tools, and guidance on setting appropriate piece rates, since homeworkers are usually paid on a piece-rate basis.</p>
                    <p>Starting in 2019, as part of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://traidcraftexchange.org/project-hidden-homeworkers">Hidden Homeworkers Programme</a>&mdash;a partnership between <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://traidcraftexchange.org/">Traidcraft Exchange</a>,* <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hnsa.org.in/">HomeNet South Asia</a>,* and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.homeworkersww.org.uk/">Homeworkers Worldwide</a>,* with financial support from the EU&mdash;a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.homeworkersww.org.uk/resources/preventing-child-labour-toolkit?/toolkitappendicies">Preventing Child Labour Toolkit</a> was developed, including practical guidance on addressing issues of child labor in homebased crafts production. The project aims to extend multi-stakeholder-led transparency and traceability systems to the lower tiers in the garment sector and improve working conditions of homeworkers in India, Nepal, and Pakistan as part of the apparel and footwear supply chains.</p>
