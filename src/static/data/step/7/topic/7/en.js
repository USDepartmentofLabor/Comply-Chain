                    In many countries, particularly developing countries, the
                    informal economy accounts for a significant portion of the
                    overall economy. A large proportion of agricultural work is
                    informal, and in the manufacturing sector, portions of
                    production are frequently subcontracted to informal
                    workshops or homes.&nbsp;

                    Child labor and forced labor typically thrive in the
                    informal economy &ndash; in unregistered workplaces outside
                    the purview of labor unions and law enforcement. Using child
                    labor in the home increases a family unit&rsquo;s
                    productivity and wages with little risk of interference from
                    regulatory bodies. In addition, the increased focus by many
                    governments and corporations on eradicating child labor may
                    have caused more of it to be driven underground into
                    informal work. The informal economy often involves the most
                    dangerous and hidden forms of work, and children are
                    extremely vulnerable to the negative impacts of the work
                    associated with informal labor situations.

                    Companies and multi-stakeholder groups have been grappling
                    with the challenges of informal work and homework for years.

                    since homeworkers are usually paid on a piece rate basis.
