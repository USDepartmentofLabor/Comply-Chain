                        systems (CLMS) in target communities. The CLMS is
                        implemented by the existing child protection mechanism,
                        Commune Councils on Women and Children, and is
                        supplemented by village-level volunteer monitors who are
                        trained by the project. These monitors track vulnerable
                        children in the community, assess whether they are
                        involved in or at risk of involvement in child labor,
                        and take action to help children get the social services
                        they need. Monitors also raise awareness about the
                        benefits of education and track children&rsquo;s school
                        attendance through meetings with teachers and home

                    A CLMS is a time-intensive and resource-intensive approach
                    to monitoring that requires extensive engagement at the
                    community level. A key advantage is that it is a
                    participatory approach that involves all appropriate
                    stakeholders from the outset and ensures that all
                    interactions with children&mdash;from identification to
                    remediation&mdash;are carried out in a culturally
                    appropriate manner.
