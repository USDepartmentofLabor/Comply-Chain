                <h1>Scheduling Audits</h1>
                <p>
                    If you are part of an industry or multi-industry group, the
                    group&rsquo;s systems and processes may drive when and how
                    you schedule audits. If you are pursuing a social compliance
                    system on your own, you will have several decisions to make
                    in scheduling your audits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, if auditing is part of a pre-screening or
                    pre-registration process (i.e., if you require potential
                    suppliers to obtain a passing score on an audit before you
                    will place your first order), you will schedule audits with
                    these facilities as soon as you believe they are ready,
                    based on their experience with audits and/or the training
                    they have received. Once the supplier has passed the audit
                    and been registered to supply to the company, audits should
                    be repeated on a periodic basis, depending on the findings
                    of the audit.

                    <p>
                        Many companies require a new supplier to earn a passing
                        score on a social audit before the company will place
                        any orders with that supplier. Typically, the company
                        provides training to prepare the supplier for the audit,
                        or may expect a vendor/agent to provide training to
                        suppliers. Once a supplier passes an audit, some
                        companies will then register each supplier in the social
                        compliance information system; other companies&rsquo;
                        information systems are web-based and allow suppliers to
                        register themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, Target Corporation* requires all vendors
                        that supply Target branded products to complete a human
                        rights and compliance assessment as part of the
                        registration process. If a vendor proposes to source
                        from a supplier that has a history of social compliance
                        violations, Target requires a completed corrective
                        action plan to remediate the violations before
                        production begins. For more information, see{" "}

                    Companies with vast supply chains and/or dispersed suppliers
                    typically conduct audits on a sampling basis. This is common
                    with audits of agricultural producers, for example. Your
                    sample should be random and statistically representative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Audits should be scheduled at times when code violations are
                    most likely to occur. For example, in agriculture, child
                    labor may be most likely to occur at harvest time. In
                    manufacturing, labor issues are most likely to occur when
                    facilities are at maximum production levels. Your risk
                    assessment should provide information to feed in to these
                    determinations.
                </p>

                    Auditing of your supply chain should also be scheduled
                    regularly. However, your audit team should also be ready to
                    react quickly if a grievance is received regarding a
                    particular worksite.
                </p>

                    Some companies allow suppliers to conduct their own
                    self-audits, in which suppliers evaluate their own
                    performance using the audit tools, and report it to the
                    company. Typically, companies may allow this for suppliers
                    who have established a pattern of excellent performance on
                    audits, and/or for suppliers located in countries where the
                    government has shown a pattern of effective labor law
                    enforcement. It is still advisable to reserve the right to
                    conduct additional audits on such suppliers. Self-auditing
                    has the advantage of raising the capacity of suppliers, but
                    results of self-auditing should still be verified by an
                    independent party.
