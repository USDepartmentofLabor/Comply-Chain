                <h1>Designing an Effective Compliance Monitoring System</h1>
                <p>Just as businesses are accustomed to tracking product quality, contract progress, and financial risks, effective social compliance requires ongoing monitoring. Monitoring helps your company understand differences between policies and actions throughout the supply chain. Strong monitoring brings risks and compliance gaps to the surface, locates specific issues among suppliers, and improves your suppliers&rsquo; alignment with your code of conduct.</p>
                <p>Social compliance monitoring systems generally follow a continuous and circular process:&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                <li><em>Monitoring:</em> Gathering data at the worker, supplier, and supply chain levels, with priority placed on the greatest risk areas.</li>
                <li><em>Addressing:</em> Assigning accountability for addressing issues identified through monitoring, often in partnership with workers.</li>
                <li><em>Analyzing:</em> Identifying compliance patterns across the supply chain and risk trends among workers.</li>
                <li><em>Improving:</em> Recommending and implementing specific changes to strengthen the entire supply chain&rsquo;s compliance.</li>
                </ul>
<p>Companies use grievance mechanisms and independent audits as two pillars of a robust social compliance monitoring strategy. Other common practices include labor-management dialogue, dialogue with suppliers, community-based monitoring, ongoing due diligence, sector benchmarking, and regular reporting on compliance monitoring. The most effective compliance monitoring systems work closely with workers and their unions, where available and effective, to implement grievance mechanisms and negotiate solutions to identified problems.</p>
