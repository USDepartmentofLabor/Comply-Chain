            <h1>Impact Evaluation </h1>
            <p>
                Some companies and social compliance initiatives have begun to
                consider impact evaluation as a way to determine the long-term
                development impact of their efforts to reduce child labor,
                forced labor and other labor rights violations in their supply
                chains. Impact evaluation is a method that establishes, with
                statistical rigor, a causal linkage and quantifiable impact of a
                specific intervention. Impact evaluation isolates the effects of
                a program or service by comparing a treatment group (those
                exposed to the program or service) to an identical group that
                does not receive the program or service.

                        Example in Action: Better Work Impact Evaluation

                <p>
                    A multidisciplinary academic team from Tufts University and
                    the ILO conducted a long-term impact evaluation of the
                    Better Work program from 2009 to 2015. The methodology
                    evaluated project outcomes beyond the factory or industry
                    level. In certain countries, the study team used the
                    methodology to look at both managers and workers to assess
                    human development and economic development indicators. In
                    other countries, impact measurement analyzed year-to-year
                    changes in factory performance using a range of other
                    qualitative research methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The study presents evidence that improvements in
                    working&nbsp;conditions lead to higher productivity and firm
                    profitability. Key findings show that workers reach daily
                    production targets nearly 40 minutes faster in factories
                    with high rates of labor law compliance than in factories
                    with lower rates. In addition, the study shows that when
                    workers are concerned about verbal abuse, it takes them
                    almost one extra hour per day to reach their production
                    target.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be noted that, while review and assessment methods
                    like independent monitoring, independent verification and
                    impact evaluation can verify that companies have robust
                    systems in place to reduce the likelihood of child labor,
                    forced labor and other labor abuses in supply chains, none
                    of these methods guarantees that these abuses are not
                    present.
