                <p>
                    Auditing has little utility unless the company is committed
                    to using audit data to improve labor conditions over time.
                    Audit data should be entered into a database system that
                    allows for thorough analysis of any particular audit, as
                    well as analysis of aggregate data over time on each
                    supplier and worksite audited, on each product line, on each
                    type of violation, on compliance in distinct geographic
                    zones, and other patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several challenges to maintaining an effective
                    audit database.
                </p>
                <h2>Data Processing</h2>
                <p>
                    First, the system must be able to effectively process data
                    coming from a variety of different individual auditors,
                    including internal and external auditors and/or audit data
                    received from industry or multi-industry group audits. If
                    your audit tools are on paper, your auditors or other staff
                    must be trained to enter data in a uniform way into the
                    system. (Some companies hire subcontractors to clean audit
                    data.) If a company also receives data from independent
                    monitors, you should include that data as well.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Training is especially important if you allow those being
                    audited to enter their own information for the
                    self-assessment. Some of these applicants may have limited
                    computer literacy or familiarity with databases and it is
                    crucial to teach them how to properly enter information to
                    ensure data integrity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before thinking about training auditors and self-assessors,
                    you should focus on database design. A well-designed
                    database can help ensure data integrity by making data easy
                    for the user to enter in the right format. A customized
                    database with a logical design means that a company only
                    gets the information it needs and that this data is useful
                    and analyzable. Any company, no matter its size, can
                    minimize faulty data by starting with a good database.
                    Additionally, data integrity checks can be automated with
                    several software programs available.
                </p>
                <h2>Integration with Other Information Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    The second challenge is integration. The database must be
                    integrated with information systems that track other social
                    compliance program data, such as supplier lists, supplier
                    training and capacity-building data, remediation, and
                    independent verification information. Second, it must be
                    integrated with other company functions, particularly
                    sourcing, so that social compliance data is utilized
                    effectively by other business units. Integration should be
                    such that the sourcing department places orders with
                    suppliers who perform well on social audits.
                </p>
                <h2>Using the Data</h2>
                <p>
                    A third challenge is setting up clear processes for the use
                    of data. Auditors should check the database as they prepare
                    for an audit, to look at the audit history of a particular
                    worksite as well as the types of violations that are common
                    in that geographic location and/or product type. The social
                    compliance team should have clear processes for analyzing
                    data from specific audits as well as tracking patterns
                    across all audits.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    If violations are found at a worksite, there should be
                    processes in place for tracking that supplier&rsquo;s
                    remediation. The team should be looking for patterns of
                    violations in specific product lines, particular regions,
                    violations related to supplier ownership/management and
                    other issues. When patterns are detected, the scheduling
                    audits should shift toward those types of worksites that
                    seem to pose greater risks. The team should also have checks
                    in place to identify &ldquo;outliers&rdquo; and verify data
                    accuracy.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    There will be times when audit data reveals serious
                    violations, and times when a particular supplier continues
                    to violate the code despite repeated audits and remediation
                    efforts. Companies will need policies to determine when to
                    continue remediation, and when to discontinue their business
                    relationship with a particular supplier. Some companies have
                    &ldquo;no tolerance&rdquo; policies in place with respect to
                    certain violations, often child labor or forced labor, for
                    which they will immediately discontinue or suspend a
                    relationship with a supplier. Others continue remediation
                    for a certain time period or to achieve specified targets,
                    but if the supplier does not show sufficient improvement,
                    the company discontinues the relationship. When terminating
                    a business relationship with a supplier, the company should
                    always keep in mind the impact of such a termination on the
                    workers.
