                <p>
                    Your social compliance team consists of your social
                    compliance staff at headquarters, as well as the personnel
                    in the field coordinating and/or carrying out audits. For
                    companies with an internal audit program, the audit team
                    members are company employees; for companies that use
                    external auditors, the audit team members are comprised of
                    hired auditors from outside entities (whether for-profit or
                    non-profit firms). Some companies use both internal and
                    external auditors, depending on the sector or location of
                    the facility.

                    All three of the auditing approaches below can be reliable
                    and credible, as long as they are well-managed by your
                    social compliance team and operate within the framework of a
                    comprehensive social compliance program. However, each
                    approach has certain advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;

                             Internal auditors are company employees who are trained in
                             the skills and competencies of social auditing. One
                             advantage to using internal auditors is that they are likely
                             to be easier to communicate with; for example, if there are
                             changes in policy, it is easier to ensure consistency among
                             your own staff than with hired external auditors. Internal
                             auditors also may have a deeper understanding of the
                             company&rsquo;s full social compliance program and may be
                             able to make contributions to it beyond auditing. On the
                             other hand, since internal auditors are company employees,
                             some stakeholders may question the credibility of their
                             findings.&nbsp;

                              External auditors are audit professionals with defined
                              skills and competencies, employed by social audit firms
                              outside a company. They are a flexible workforce and may be
                              available in geographic locations where it is not
                              cost-effective for a company to maintain internal auditors.
                              Since external auditors are paid by the company to do audits, 
                              some stakeholders may doubt the credibility of their audit findings. 
                              In addition, some external audit groups may have their own systems 
                              in place that cannot be fully adapted to match a company&rsquo;s own
                              protocols or parameters. A business that relies on an independent

                              audit must also weigh and consider that particular entity which 
                              conducts the audit. A third party, independent auditorâ€™s status 
                              as such does not guarantee an absence of risk.

                                 Independent auditors/monitors are audit professionals
                                 accredited by institutions or mechanisms, such as trade or 
                                 professional organizations; their role is to
                                 ensure that auditing takes place while eliminating any
                                 direct financial transaction between the company and the
                                 auditor. Typically, a company pays a separate, independent
                                 institution for auditing services, and/or for membership in
                                 that body. The institution accredits auditors under its
                                 established standards and is responsible for scheduling and
                                 oversight of all audits. While this is designed to increase 
                                 the credibility of the audit, in some sectors or geographic 
                                 locations, this type of arrangement may not be available. In addition, 
                                 even without a direct financial transaction, some stakeholders 
                                 may still have concerns about the degree of an auditor&rsquo;s 
                                 independence from the audited entity. Varying degrees of independence
                                  exist, and independence ultimately needs to be judged on a case-by-case basis.

                    possess specific skills and knowledge in order to carry out
                    audits effectively. In the past few years, several

                    understanding of international labor standards, industry

                    It&rsquo;s important that auditors also be trained in
                    specific protocols for handling sensitive situations
                    involving children and/or adult victims of egregious
                    exploitation. Auditors should be prepared to interact with
                    children and take measures on behalf of children that are
                    age appropriate. An auditing firm should also have procedures 
                    to ensure that victims of child labor or forced labor 
                    receive immediate care and services from qualified individuals

                <h2>Team Composition</h2>
                <p>
                    The size and composition of an audit team depends on the
                    size and type of facility to be audited, the number of
                    workers in the facility, and the nature of the workforce,
                    including the languages and cultural composition of the
                    workers. If the facility is large and a variety of languages
                    are spoken, auditors who speak every language must be
                    available. Gender of the workers is also an important
                    consideration; for example, it normally is preferable for
                    women to be interviewed by a woman in order to facilitate
                    more comfortable discussions about issues such as sexual
                    harassment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many companies prefer auditors to be nationals of the
                    countries where they will perform audits, because they know
                    the culture, language and customs of the country, and hiring
                    local auditors also contributes to sustainable local
                    capacity-building.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team leader should ensure that the team functions
                    interactively. Because violations can often be subtle, or
                    deliberately concealed from auditors, the team should not
                    simply divide up work responsibilities; in many cases, more
                    than one auditor should examine the same issues, and the
                    team should come together to assess findings and ensure that
                    connections and patterns are identified. The team should
                    collectively agree on the final audit findings.

                        are hired locally and receive extensive training. A new
                        advisor is always paired with a more experienced
                        colleague, and no two advisors are paired on consecutive
                        visits to a particular factory. Advisors conducting
                        assessments for a particular factory are never the same
                        individuals providing remediation and advisory services
                        to that factory.
