                <h1>Grievance Mechanisms</h1>
                <p>Grievance mechanisms are a cornerstone of worker representation. They allow unions to raise workers&rsquo; issues through an established, transparent systems that alleviate workers&rsquo; fear of reprisal from employers. However, workers without the protection of an effective union and collective bargaining agreement should also have ways to express concerns and bring their perspectives to management. Workers should have whistleblower protections that empower them to safely report serious concerns.</p>
                <p>Effective grievance mechanisms are an important step toward stronger dialogue between workers and management and improved compliance. Along with anonymous complaint channels and labor-management dialogue, robust grievance mechanisms benefit businesses by providing information on workplace problems that can impact product quality, staff turnover, and corporate liability.</p>
                <p>At a minimum, companies should ensure that safe, accessible grievance channels are available to workers to lodge complaints about any issue related to your code of conduct. Ideally, multiple channels should be available, such as through trade unions (if available), through supervisors or supplier management, directly to a company, or to a third-party that you engage for this purpose. Emerging technology that anonymously captures worker perspectives is another channel that helps businesses receive feedback and grievances directly from workers across their supply chain (See also Addressing the Vulnerability of Migrants in Codes of Conduct). Procedures for bringing a grievance to each available channel should be clearly explained at training sessions and posted at the worksite in all applicable languages. When auditors or independent verification organizations visit worksites, workers should be afforded a confidential setting away from supervisors or managers to make known any complaints.</p>
                <p>Standard procedures should also be in place for handling and resolving complaints that are received through all channels. These procedures should be clearly explained and posted. The procedures should include protection of privacy and protection from reprisal for the person or group bringing the complaint, and a communications protocol to notify both the complainant and other affected stakeholders of the outcome of the grievance.</p>
                <p>Over time, businesses should evaluate the effectiveness of their grievance mechanisms. Some best practices for evaluation and considerations include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uptake</strong><em>:</em> Businesses should track the number of grievances submitted over time, while noting that lower grievance rates may not reflect lower prevalence of social compliance gaps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Themes</strong><em>:</em> Grievance data analysis pinpoints priority areas for intervention. The absence of certain types of grievances may also be a risk indicator.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility</strong><em>:</em> Companies should assess whether all workers have equal access and ability to submit grievances by considering diversity and inclusion, or if certain workers face other obstacles to submitting grievances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><em>:</em> Companies should examine any standard operating procedures that relate to grievance confidentiality, whistleblower protections, and reprisals. Testing grievance mechanisms through third-party auditing is another good practice.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Grievance resolution rate</strong><em>:</em> Companies should measure the proportion of grievances that are satisfactorily remediated and how long they take to close (see Step 6: Remediate Violations for further information on remediation).</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>Technologies that capture worker voice are often cost effective, targeted, and safe for workers. They can provide a valuable supplement to traditional social audits, as well as provide effective mechanisms for educating workers on their rights and available resources.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Many initiatives rely on smartphone technology to administer anonymous surveys that poll workers on their working conditions in factories and fields. Other platforms are deployed to offer digital access to formal grievance procedures.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Issara Institute* operates a worker voice smartphone application called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.issarainstitute.org/golden-dreams">Golden Dreams</a> in Southeast Asia. The application offers a recruitment marketplace for workers, which in turn enables companies in Thailand to improve conditions in their supply chains, including suppliers of major retailers like ALDI*. This platform offers Burmese, Cambodian, and Thai migrant workers information on ethical recruitment, including ratings of specific employers, recruiters, and service providers. Golden Dreams, along with Issara, also gives workers a channel to anonymously report problems or seek immediate assistance through a free hotline and messaging feature.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Other initiatives, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.contratados.org/">Contratados.org</a>,* utilize web-based technology to create online platforms by which workers, including migrants, can rate and comment on labor recruiters and contractors in their native languages.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Many available technologies provide pathways to report worker grievances but do not provide avenues for remedying individual or collective violations of worker rights. The ILO&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_622209.pdf">Factsheet on Grievance Handling</a> provides best practices on legitimate, independent grievance mechanisms that should be integrated into technology platforms to advance worker voice.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Unilever* is a British-Dutch multinational company that produces a wide range of products that use palm oil as an ingredient, including food, beauty, and household cleaning products. Unilever works closely with its suppliers to promote decent work across its palm oil supply chain, including developing a process by which workers&rsquo; grievances can be communicated and addressed.</p>
                    <p>The Unilever process includes three important steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An acknowledgement of the grievance and a preliminary review to determine whether the grievance is applicable to its supply chain.</li>
                        <li>An in-depth review of the grievance, working with the supplier and an independent organization to develop a time-bound action and remediation plan.</li>
                        <li>Actions implemented by the supplier to resolve the issue, with the outcomes monitored.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unilever will often involve an independent organization at various stages to collate further information and outline the requirements for the supplier. The company works with its suppliers to help improve practices and resolve issues. However, it takes appropriate action consistent with its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.unilever.com/Images/unilever-palm-oil-policy-2016_tcm244-479933_en.pdf">Five Principles for Sustainable Palm Oil</a> against suppliers who are unwilling or unable to comply.<br />As of January 2019, Unilever began publicly disclosing the grievances against its suppliers through a published <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.unilever.com/Images/unilever-palm-oil-grievance-tracker_tcm244-530071_en.pdf">grievance tracker</a>.</p>

Such mechanisms can be administered by an enterprise alone or in collaboration with other stakeholders and can be a source of continuous learning.

                <p>In 2009&ndash;2010, the Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative (CSRI) at the Harvard Kennedy School examined pilot projects commissioned by the UN Special Representative on Business and Human Rights. These pilots were focused on testing grievance mechanisms involving business enterprises and the communities in which they operate. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.respect.international/piloting-principles-for-effective-company-stakeholder-grievance-mechanisms-a-report-of-lessons-learned/">CSRI project</a> resulted in a revised set of principles for effective grievance mechanisms which was incorporated into Principle 31 of the UN Guiding Principles: Effectiveness Criteria for Non-Judicial Grievance Mechanisms:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><strong>Legitimate: </strong>Enabling trust from the stakeholder groups for whose use they are intended and being accountable for the fair conduct of grievance processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessible: </strong>Being known to all stakeholder groups for whose use they are intended and providing adequate assistance for those who may face particular barriers to access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Predictable: </strong>Providing a clear and known procedure with an indicative time frame for each state and clarity on the types of process and outcome available and means of monitoring implementation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equitable: </strong>Seeking to ensure that aggrieved parties have reasonable access to sources of information, advice, and expertise necessary to engage in a grievance process on fair, informed, and respectful terms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent: </strong>Keeping parties to a grievance informed about its progress and providing sufficient information about the mechanism&rsquo;s performance to build confidence in its effectiveness and meet any public interest at stake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rights-compatible: </strong>Ensuring that outcomes and remedies accord with internationally recognized human rights.</li>
                    <li><strong>A source of continuous learning: </strong>Drawing on relevant measures to identify lessons for improving the mechanism and preventing future grievances and harms.</li>
                    <p>Operational-level mechanisms should also be:</p>
                    <li><strong>Based on engagement and dialogue: </strong>Consulting the stakeholder groups for whose use they are intended on their design and performance and focusing on dialogue as the means to address and resolve grievances.</li>
