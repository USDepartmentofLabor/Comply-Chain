                        with recruitment of young people: a) to assess their

                        When interviewing a child that you suspect to be below
                        the minimum required age for the particular type of job
                        or where the child has been engaged in hazardous work,
                        it is important to create a trusting and relaxed
                        atmosphere. It is also important that the conversation
                        takes place in an undisturbed but not too remote and out
                        of sight environment. Essentially, the child must feel
                        as secure as possible.

                        alone with children away from others in order not to
                        create unnecessary worry for the child and create a

                        behavior and abuse.
