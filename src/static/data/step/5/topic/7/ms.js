                <p>
                    Effective communication is an important aspect of any social
                    compliance program. Many companies have learned that merely
                    auditing workplaces and remediating violations alone does
                    not solve many of the labor problems found at harvesting,
                    mining and production sites, processing facilities and other
                    workplaces. Ongoing training and communication, capacity
                    building and an emphasis on continuous improvement have been
                    found to be the most effective path to sustaining progress
                    toward greater compliance.

                        Step 4, Communicate and Train Across Your Supply Chain
                    </Link>{" "}
                    will discuss the ins and outs of communicating your code and
                    compliance system to a variety of audiences: your own
                    employees, your shareholders, your suppliers, supplier
                    managers and supervisors, workers at facilities throughout
                    the supply chain, governments, workers&rsquo; organizations,
                    community groups and others. It will also discuss ways to
                    make the code more accessible to stakeholders by avoiding
                    unnecessary technical jargon and providing for translation
                    into multiple languages.
