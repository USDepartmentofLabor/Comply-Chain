            <p>
                In many countries, particularly developing countries, the
                informal economy accounts for a significant portion of the
                overall economy. A large proportion of agricultural work is
                informal, and in the manufacturing sector, portions of
                production are frequently subcontracted to informal workshops or
                homes.&nbsp;

                Child labor and forced labor typically thrive in the informal
                economy &ndash; in unregistered workplaces outside the purview
                of labor unions and law enforcement. Using child labor in the
                home increases a family unit&rsquo;s productivity and wages with
                little risk of interference from regulatory bodies. In addition,
                the increased focus by many governments and corporations on
                eradicating child labor may have caused more of it to be driven
                underground into informal work. The informal economy often
                involves the most dangerous and hidden forms of work, and
                children are extremely vulnerable to the negative impacts of the
                work associated with informal labor situations.

                Companies and multi-stakeholder groups have been grappling with
                the challenges of informal work and homework for years. In 2010,
                the Ethical Trading Initiative published{" "}

                <em> for both retailers and suppliers</em>. These guidelines and
                their supporting documents include tools such as a model policy
                for retailers and suppliers on homework, research guides for
                identifying homework in supply chains, mapping tools, and
                guidance on setting appropriate piece rates, since homeworkers
                are usually paid on a piece rate basis.
