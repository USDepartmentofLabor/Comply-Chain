                <h1>International Framework Agreements (IFAs)</h1>
                <p>
                    IFAs, also known as Global Framework Agreements (GFAs), differ from company codes of conduct in that they are negotiated instruments 
                    between multinational enterprises and global union federations intended to ensure that companies commit to respecting a number of core 
                    principles covering labor relations and working conditions. IFAs vary but are based on ILO core labor standards, focusing in particular 
                    on two broad categories of standards: (1) fundamental principles and rights at work (freedom of association, collective bargaining, 
                    non-discrimination, abolition of forced labor, and elimination of child labor) and minimum terms and conditions of employment (working 
                    time, wages, occupational safety, and health); and (2) other conditions of work: mobility and related issues such as training, job security, 
                    subcontracting, and restructuring.

                    The first IFA was signed in 1988 by the French transnational food company BSN (renamed Danone* in 1994) and the International Union of Food, 
                    Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers&rsquo; Associations* (IUF). The parties agreed that the IFA would cover 
                    all global operations, which, as of 2008, encompassed approximately 100,000 employees worldwide. The initial agreement stated that both parties 
                    would promote coordinated initiatives on issues including job skills training, coordinating information across countries, ensuring gender 
                    equity, and implementing trade union rights as defined in specific ILO conventions. In March 2016,{" "}

                                specific conditions, Danone and IUF agreed to promote permanent, sustainable, and direct forms of employment, which they agreed

                    and trade unions that is governed by a steering committee consisting of brand representatives and union representatives. The 
                    International Accord developed from the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety, which first emerged in 2013 after the tragic 
                    Rana Plaza collapse and the Tazreen factory fire, and continued for 8 years to monitor fire and building safety for 1,600 Bangladeshi 
                    garment factories. This new iteration contains key elements of the original Bangladesh Accord such as rigorous garment factory 
                    inspections, as well as an agreement of shared governance by labor and brands among others, in addition to new features like prohibition 
                    of third-party interference with respect to worker-lodged complaints and an understanding to expand the new International Accord beyond
