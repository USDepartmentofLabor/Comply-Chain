                <h1>International Framework Agreements (IFAs)</h1>
                <p>
                    IFAs, also known as Global Framework Agreements (GFA),
                    differ from company codes of conduct in that they are{" "}
                    <em>negotiated</em> instruments between multinational
                    enterprises and global union federations intended to ensure
                    companies commit to respecting a number of core principles
                    covering labor relations and working conditions. IFAs vary
                    but are based on ILO core labor standards, focusing in
                    particular on two broad categories of standards: (a)
                    fundamental principles and rights at work (freedom of
                    association, collective bargaining, non-discrimination,
                    abolition of forced labor, elimination of child labor) and
                    minimum terms and conditions of employment (working time,
                    wages, occupational safety and health); and (b) other
                    conditions of work: mobility and related issues such as
                    training, job security, subcontracting and
                    restructuring.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                The first IFA was signed in 1988 by the French transnational food company BSN (renamed Danone* in 1994) and the
                International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers’ Associations* (IUF).
                The parties agreed that the IFA would cover all global operations, which as of 2008 encompassed about 100,000 employees worldwide.
                The initial agreement stated that both parties would promote coordinated initiatives on issues including job skills training, coordinating
                information across countries, ensuring gender equity and implementing trade union rights as defined in specific ILO conventions.
                In March 2016, Danone and IUF signed their tenth agreement, which focuses on sustainable employment and worker rights and applies to the company’s subsidiaries across the globe.

                    and apparel retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz, covering 1.6
                    million garment workers. The agreement promotes collective
                    bargaining agreements at the company and factory levels,
                    gives workers the explicit right to refuse unsafe work,
                    prohibits discrimination against worker representatives, and
                    ensures that both management and union representatives are
                    trained on employers&rsquo; responsibilities, workers&rsquo;
                    rights and obligations, industrial relations, collective

                                                 and IUF agreed to reduce precarious employment through “clear definitions, processes, and methodology.”  To this end,

                                                  seasonal activity, specific competencies needed, or the acquisition of the company.”  By spelling out these specific conditions,
                                                  the Danone and IUF agreed to promote permanent, sustainable, and direct-forms of employment, which they agreed best promotes “the
