                <p>
                    IFAs, also known as Global Framework Agreements (GFA),
                    differ from company codes of conduct in that they are{" "}
                    <em>negotiated</em> instruments between multinational
                    enterprises and global union federations intended to ensure
                    companies commit to respecting a number of core principles
                    covering labor relations and working conditions. IFAs vary
                    but are based on ILO core labor standards, focusing in
                    particular on two broad categories of standards: (a)
                    fundamental principles and rights at work (freedom of
                    association, collective bargaining, non-discrimination,
                    abolition of forced labor, elimination of child labor) and
                    minimum terms and conditions of employment (working time,
                    wages, occupational safety and health); and (b) other
                    conditions of work: mobility and related issues such as
                    training, job security, subcontracting and
                    restructuring.&nbsp;

                    and apparel retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz, covering 1.6
                    million garment workers. The agreement promotes collective
                    bargaining agreements at the company and factory levels,
                    gives workers the explicit right to refuse unsafe work,
                    prohibits discrimination against worker representatives, and
                    ensures that both management and union representatives are
                    trained on employers&rsquo; responsibilities, workers&rsquo;
                    rights and obligations, industrial relations, collective
                    bargaining agreements and peaceful conflict resolution,
                    among other topics. The first IFA was signed in 1988 by the
                    French transnational food company BSN (renamed Danone in
                    1994) and the International Union of Food, Agricultural,
                    Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied
                    Workers&rsquo; Associations (IUF). The parties agreed that
                    the IFA would cover all global operations, which as of 2008
                    encompassed about 100,000 employees worldwide. The initial
                    agreement stated that both parties would promote coordinated
                    initiatives on issues including job skills training,
                    coordinating information across countries, ensuring gender
                    equity and implementing trade union rights as defined in
                    specific ILO conventions. In March 2016,{" "}
