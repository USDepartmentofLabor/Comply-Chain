                    Addressing the Vulnerability of Migrants in Codes of Conduct
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Often, the workers who are most vulnerable to forced
                    labor/trafficking are migrant and temporary workers, who
                    make up a significant proportion of the workforce in certain
                    industries and parts of the world. In some cases, employers
                    obtain migrant and temporary labor through labor brokerage
                    or recruitment services. Workers are highly vulnerable to a
                    wide range of abuses in these situations. Some recruiters
                    confiscate workers&rsquo; identity documents as a means to
                    entrap them, and/or deceive workers about the nature of the
                    work they will be doing, the working conditions, the housing
                    and living arrangements, and other aspects of their
                    employment. In some cases, workers are made to pay fees to
                    recruiters, brokers and other actors along the migration
                    chain&ndash;fees which may be impossible to pay back and
                    lead to debt bondage. As enshrined in ILO Convention 181,
                    all costs of recruiting labor should be borne by the
                    employer&mdash;workers should never pay any cost to obtain a
                    job.

                    If you know or suspect that there is migrant labor in your
                    supply chain, it is important to include relevant standards
                    and provisions in your code of conduct.&nbsp;

                        Standards
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        When 2011 audits revealed indicators of forced labor, human trafficking, and
                        labor exploitation in Patagonia’s supplier factories in Taiwan, the outdoor apparel
                        company realized that despite its existing Supplier Workplace Code of Conduct, more
                        robust standards were needed.  Patagonia collaborated with Verité,* an NGO that promotes safe,
                        fair, and legal working conditions worldwide, to conduct research to better understand the situation
                        of migrant workers in their supply chain.  Upon finding that many migrants fall victims to an exploitative
                        labor recruitment system that leaves workers laden with excessive broker fees and vulnerable to debt bondage,
                        Patagonia developed comprehensive migrant worker standards.  These standards ban supplier factories from charging
                        recruitment fees and cover a range of other issues relevant for migrant workers, including living and working conditions,
                        wages, and grievance procedures.  Patagonia’s Migrant Worker Employment Standards are publicly available and are going through
                        a revision in 2020.  Patagonia states that through their work with suppliers to implement the standard and by other brands
                        joining the effort, “Patagonia has made significant progress in moving their suppliers to a system where workers do not pay recruitment fees.”

                    In some cases, migrant workers are provided accommodations
                    by their employers as part of the terms of employment. For
                    employers, this is a means to recruit and keep valuable
                    employees, and for migrant workers who have traveled far
                    from home, this arrangement can provide needed housing.
                    However, such housing must be safe, clean and appropriate to
                    the worker population. Workers must always have freedom of
                    movement, and the right to choose other housing if they
                    wish. According to the ILO, if workers are living in
                    &ldquo;degrading living conditions&rdquo; in
                    employer-provided housing, and are also subject to some form
                    of penalty or threat preventing them from leaving their
                    jobs, this would amount to a forced labor situation.
