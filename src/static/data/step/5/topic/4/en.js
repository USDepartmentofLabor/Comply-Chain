                    Addressing the Vulnerability of Migrants in Codes of Conduct
                </h1>
                <p>Often, the workers who are most vulnerable to forced labor and trafficking are migrant and temporary workers, who make up a significant proportion of the workforce in certain industries and parts of the world. Migrant workers may be particularly vulnerable to forced labor due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Education: Some migrant workers have low levels of education or may be illiterate, raising risks that they may not understand their employment contract or their rights.</li>
                    <li>Isolation: Migrants may live in employer-provided housing or on employer-owned property, where they may be isolated from external sources of support and may not feel safe speaking openly about abuse. Employers may control access to worker housing, limiting the reach of outside inspectors or advocates.</li>
                    <li>Language: Many migrant workers do not speak the language of their destination country, making it challenging for them to understand their work agreements, understand local labor laws, and communicate with managers and authorities.</li>
                    <li>Legal Status: Some migrant workers are dependent on their employer for their work visa. Others may work abroad without a visa or work permit. In both cases, the power imbalance between companies and workers may leave many migrants unable to fully access their rights due to fear of deportation.</li>
                    <li>Prohibitions on the right to organize: In some countries with large populations of migrant workers, it is legally prohibited for migrant workers to form or join unions.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Recruitment Fees: Many migrant workers pay fees to recruitment agencies and brokers for placement in jobs abroad; these fees may cover costs such as travel, visa, and other recruitment formalities, in addition to unspecified &ldquo;fees&rdquo; that are often substantial and sometimes structured as high-interest loans.</li>
                    <li>Remittances: Many migrant workers financially support family in their home countries. In many cases, jobs abroad pay significantly higher wages to migrant workers than jobs at home. This dynamic discourages workers from speaking up, filing grievances, or leaving their employer&mdash;even in cases of serious labor abuses.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In some cases, migrant workers are provided accommodations by their employers as part of the terms of employment. For employers, this is a means to recruit and keep valuable employees, and for migrant workers who have traveled far from home, this arrangement can provide needed housing. However, such housing must be safe, clean, and appropriate to the worker population. When permissible, workers should have freedom of movement and the right to choose other housing. According to the ILO, &ldquo;degrading living conditions&rdquo; imposed by an employer, recruiter, or other third-party are a strong indicator of forced labor.</p>
                <p>In some cases, employers obtain migrant and temporary labor through labor brokerage or recruitment services (see Step 2: Assess Risks and Impacts). Workers are highly vulnerable to a wide range of abuses in these situations. Some recruiters confiscate workers&rsquo; identity documents as a means to entrap them, or they may deceive workers about the nature of the work they will be doing, the working conditions, the housing and living arrangements, and other aspects of their employment. In some cases, workers are made to pay fees to recruiters, brokers, and other actors along the migration chain&mdash;fees which may be impossible to pay back and lead to debt bondage. As enshrined in ILO Convention 181, all costs of recruiting labor should be borne by the employer&mdash;workers should never pay any cost to obtain a job.</p>
                <p>If you know or suspect that there is migrant labor in your supply chain, it is important to include relevant standards and provisions in your code of conduct and service-level agreements.</p>

                        Example in Action: Patagonia&rsquo;s* Migrant Worker
                        Standards
                    </h2>
                    <p>When 2011 audits revealed indicators of forced labor, human trafficking, and labor exploitation in Patagonia&rsquo;s supplier factories in Taiwan, the outdoor apparel company realized that despite its existing Supplier Workplace Code of Conduct, more robust standards were needed. Patagonia collaborated with Verit&eacute;,* an NGO that promotes safe, fair, and legal working conditions worldwide, to conduct research to better understand the situation of migrant workers in their supply chain. Upon finding that many migrants fall victim to an exploitative labor recruitment system that leaves workers laden with excessive broker fees and vulnerable to debt bondage, Patagonia developed comprehensive migrant worker standards. These standards ban supplier factories from charging recruitment fees and cover a range of other issues relevant for migrant workers, including living and working conditions, wages, and grievance procedures. Patagonia&rsquo;s Migrant Worker Employment Standards are publicly available and were updated in 2020. Patagonia states that through their work with suppliers to implement the standards and by other brands joining the effort, &ldquo;Patagonia has made significant progress in moving their suppliers to a system where workers do not pay recruitment fees.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>An important policy document focused on vulnerable migrant workers is the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/SRMigrants/ConsultationRecruitment/DhakaPrinciples.pdf"> Dhaka Principles for Migration with Dignity</a> (Dhaka Principles). The Dhaka Principles consist of 10 principles that trace the worker from recruitment through employment to the end of the employment relationship. The document provides key principles that employers and migrant recruiters should respect to ensure migration with dignity. The Dhaka Principles and accompanying <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ihrb.org/dhaka-principles/implementation-guidance">implementation guidance</a> were developed by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute for Human Rights and Business (IHRB)</a>* and are supported by businesses, governments, trade unions, and civil society. They are based on international human rights standards and the three pillars of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf">UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a>.</p>
                <p>Companies should ensure that their code of conduct and service-level agreements integrate best practice principles to reduce the vulnerabilities of migrant workers. The 10 Dhaka Principles are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>No fees are charged to migrant workers.</li>
                    <li>All migrant worker contracts are clear and transparent.</li>
                    <li>Policies and procedures are inclusive.</li>
                    <li>No migrant workers&rsquo; passports or identity documents are retained.</li>
                    <li>Wages are paid regularly, directly, and on time.</li>
                    <li>The right to worker representation is respected.</li>
                    <li>Working conditions are safe and decent.</li>
                    <li>Living conditions are safe and decent.</li>
                    <li>Access to remedy is provided.</li>
                    <li>Freedom to change employment is respected, and safe and timely return is guaranteed.&nbsp;</li>

                    </h2>
                    <p>There are a growing number of migrant worker recruitment agencies that adhere to international labor standards. These companies do not charge recruitment fees and commit to a code of conduct that prohibits forced labor. Ethical recruitment agencies aim to capitalize on growing private sector demand for compliant migrant worker recruitment, which in turn reduces exploitation in the overseas labor recruitment sector.</p>
                    <p>The Global Fund to End Modern Slavery (GFEMS) has invested in several ethical recruitment start-ups, including the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gfems.org/case_studies/fair-employment-foundation/">Fair Employment Foundation</a>* in Hong Kong, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gfems.org/uncategorized/update-tera-is-creating-demand-for-ethical-recruitment-in-india/">The Ethical Recruitment Agency</a>* (TERA) in India, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gfems.org/case_studies/pinkcollar/">Pinkcollar</a>* in Malaysia. In Mexico and the United States, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ciertoglobal.org/about/">CIERTO</a>* describes itself as &ldquo;the leading provider of responsible farm worker recruiting for growers in North America.&rdquo; CIERTO recruits migrant farm workers under the H-2A program and works with third-party verifiers to monitor its workers. While recruitment models vary, some ethical recruitment start-ups reduce forced labor risks among migrant workers by:&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adhering to a code of conduct that draws on best practices from ILO, IOM, and industry groups.</li>
                        <li>Monitoring or eliminating subagents from the recruitment process.</li>
                        <li>Providing practical predeparture training to workers on their employment contracts, rights, and the destination country.</li>
                        <li>Conducting worker welfare monitoring and operating independent grievance mechanisms.</li>
                        <li>Conducting marketing activities in migrant worker communities that raise awareness of forced labor and safe migration practices.</li>
                        <li>Engaging employers and stakeholders to build capacity related to worker rights and responsible recruitment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The National Security Council&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Collaborative-Migration-Management-Strategy.pdf">Collaborative Migration Management Strategy</a>, announced in July 2021, included two lines of action advancing responsible recruitment. The strategy calls forexpanded support for migrant worker protections, including ethical recruitment. It also includes engagement with labor unions and worker rights organizations to identify ways to improve transparency in the recruitment process and overall worker protections.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The U.S. Department of Labor is supporting responsible recruitment through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/fair-fish-fostering-accountability-recruitment-fishery-workers">the FAIR Fish project</a>. This project helps create a fair global playing field for workers and responsible U.S. businesses by engaging with the private sector to reduce forced labor and human trafficking in the fishing and seafood processing sectors in Thailand. FAIR Fish has developed practical tools to support responsible recruitment in the supply chains of small and medium-size enterprises, as well as their recruiters.These tools&mdash;designed for a virtual environment due to COVID-19&mdash;include an app related to education on forced labor, a Responsible Recruitment (RR) online course, and communication materials. Other activities include establishing a business case for responsible recruitment, coaching targeted recruitment agencies to comply with the companies&rsquo; new recruitment policies, and developing an International Business Engagement Activity map to support demand for ethical recruitment among international employers and buyers. By working directly with companies and their labor recruiters, the project helps these companies improve their approaches to addressing forced labor and human trafficking in recruitment processes, strengthen compliance with recruitment policies and procedures by third-party recruiters, and promote responsible recruitment among other small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

                <p>Companies and civil society groups are increasingly turning to worker voice platforms as an important tool in addressing the vulnerabilities of migrant workers and improving employee engagement. These applications provide companies with direct lines of communication with migrant workers in their supply chain. Digital worker voice platforms often offer health, safety, and environment (HSE); operations; and sustainability staff real-time information that helps identify and address social compliance risks, including specific code of conduct violations and worker grievances.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Some applications amplify worker voice through peer-to-peer information-sharing and access to support services.
