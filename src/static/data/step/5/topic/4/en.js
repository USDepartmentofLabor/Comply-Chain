            <h1>Scheduling Audits</h1>
            <p>
                If you are part of an industry or multi-industry group, the
                group&rsquo;s systems and processes may drive when and how you
                schedule audits. If you are pursuing a social compliance system
                on your own, you will have several decisions to make in
                scheduling your audits.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, if auditing is part of a pre-screening or
                pre-registration process (i.e., if you require potential
                suppliers to obtain a passing score on an audit before you will
                place your first order), you will schedule audits with these
                facilities as soon as you believe they are ready, based on their
                experience with audits and/or the training they have received.
                Once the supplier has passed the audit and been registered to
                supply to the company, audits should be repeated on a periodic
                basis, depending on the findings of the audit.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many companies require a new supplier to earn a passing
                    score on a social audit before the company will place any
                    orders with that supplier. Typically, the company provides
                    training to prepare the supplier for the audit, or may
                    expect a vendor/agent to provide training to suppliers. Once
                    a supplier passes an audit, some companies will then
                    register each supplier in the social compliance information
                    system; other companies&rsquo; information systems are
                    web-based and allow suppliers to register themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, Target Corporation* requires all vendors that
                    supply Target branded products to complete a human rights
                    and compliance assessment as part of the registration
                    process. If a vendor proposes to source from a supplier that
                    has a history of social compliance violations, Target
                    requires a completed corrective action plan to remediate the
                    violations before production begins. For more information,

                Companies with vast supply chains and/or dispersed suppliers
                typically conduct audits on a sampling basis. This is common
                with audits of agricultural producers, for example. Your sample
                should be random and statistically representative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Audits should be scheduled at times when code violations are
                most likely to occur. For example, in agriculture, child labor
                may be most likely to occur at harvest time. In manufacturing,
                labor issues are most likely to occur when facilities are at
                maximum production levels. Your risk assessment should provide
                information to feed in to these determinations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Auditing of your supply chain should also be scheduled
                regularly. However, your audit team should also be ready to
                react quickly if a grievance is received regarding a particular
                worksite.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some companies allow suppliers to conduct their own self-audits,
                in which suppliers evaluate their own performance using the
                audit tools, and report it to the company. Typically, companies
                may allow this for suppliers who have established a pattern of
                excellent performance on audits, and/or for suppliers located in
                countries where the government has shown a pattern of effective
                labor law enforcement. It is still advisable to reserve the
                right to conduct additional audits on such suppliers.
                Self-auditing has the advantage of raising the capacity of
                suppliers, but results of self-auditing should still be verified
                by an independent party.
