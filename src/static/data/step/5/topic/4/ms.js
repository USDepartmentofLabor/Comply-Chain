                    Addressing the Vulnerability of Migrants in Codes of Conduct
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Often, the workers who are most vulnerable to forced
                    labor/trafficking are migrant and temporary workers, who
                    make up a significant proportion of the workforce in certain
                    industries and parts of the world. In some cases, employers
                    obtain migrant and temporary labor through labor brokerage
                    or recruitment services. Workers are highly vulnerable to a
                    wide range of abuses in these situations. Some recruiters
                    confiscate workers&rsquo; identity documents as a means to
                    entrap them, and/or deceive workers about the nature of the
                    work they will be doing, the working conditions, the housing
                    and living arrangements, and other aspects of their
                    employment. In some cases, workers are made to pay fees to
                    recruiters, brokers and other actors along the migration
                    chain&ndash;fees which may be impossible to pay back and
                    lead to debt bondage. As enshrined in ILO Convention 181,
                    all costs of recruiting labor should be borne by the
                    employer&mdash;workers should never pay any cost to obtain a
                    job.

                        <strong>Transitioning to Direct Employment</strong>

                    <p>
                        &ldquo;Based on independent research and audit results,
                        foreign migrant workers who are employed through
                        outsourced employment relationships are often found to
                        be more vulnerable to exploitation than those employed
                        directly by suppliers. While many suppliers undertake
                        extensive monitoring of the recruitment agents employing
                        and managing their workers, many violations remain
                        difficult to detect and address. Until there are
                        significant structural reforms to the recruitment agent
                        systems in both sending and receiving countries we
                        believe that direct employment by suppliers is necessary
                        to offer greater protections to foreign migrant workers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means that with respect to HP suppliers, all
                        foreign migrant workers must be employed and paid
                        directly by the supplier, not by agents, sub-agents, or
                        third parties. Recognizing that many suppliers rely on
                        recruitment agents, at least in part, to handle on-site
                        management of foreign migrant workers, there will be a
                        need for a transition period to move all new and
                        existing foreign migrant workers to direct
                        employment.&rdquo;

                    If you know or suspect that there is migrant labor in your
                    supply chain, it is important to include relevant standards

                    <p>
                        When 2011 audits revealed indicators of forced labor,
                        human trafficking, and labor exploitation in
                        Patagonia&rsquo;s supplier factories in Taiwan, the
                        outdoor apparel company realized that despite its
                        existing Supplier Workplace Code of Conduct, more robust
                        standards were needed. Patagonia collaborated with
                        Verit&eacute;*, an NGO that promotes safe, fair, and
                        legal working conditions worldwide, to conduct research
                        to better understand the situation of migrant workers in
                        their supply chain. Upon finding that many migrants fall
                        victims to an exploitative labor recruitment system that
                        leaves workers laden with excessive broker fees and
                        vulnerable to debt bondage, Patagonia developed
                        comprehensive migrant worker standards. These standards
                        ban supplier factories from charging recruitment fees
                        and cover a range of other issues relevant for migrant
                        workers, including living and working conditions, wages,
                        and greivance procedures. Patagonia&rsquo;s{" "}

                    In some cases, migrant workers are provided accommodations
                    by their employers as part of the terms of employment. For
                    employers, this is a means to recruit and keep valuable
                    employees, and for migrant workers who have traveled far
                    from home, this arrangement can provide needed housing.
                    However, such housing must be safe, clean and appropriate to
                    the worker population. Workers must always have freedom of
                    movement, and the right to choose other housing if they
                    wish. According to the ILO, if workers are living in
                    &ldquo;degrading living conditions&rdquo; in
                    employer-provided housing, and are also subject to some form
                    of penalty or threat preventing them from leaving their
                    jobs, this would amount to a forced labor situation.
