                <h1>What Makes a Good Code of Conduct?</h1>
                <p>
                    Codes take nearly as many forms and formats as there are
                    companies. Some codes are stand-alone documents, while
                    others are presented within broader statements of company
                    mission, values or policies. Some are included in supplier
                    guidance documents that include other requirements, such as
                    product quality. Increasingly, companies are including code
                    of conduct language in multiple documents, as social
                    compliance considerations become more interwoven within
                    corporate strategy across business units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some code documents are very general&mdash;merely laying out
                    the broad areas of compliance&mdash;while others are much
                    more detailed. In either case, the code typically is a
                    foundation for more detailed guidance for the
                    decision-makers who implement the social compliance system
                    within the company. For instance, the auditing tools derived
                    from a code are discussed under{" "}

                    A good code of conduct should be a public document and state
                    clearly the actors within the company that are responsible
                    for its development, oversight and implementation which
                    should include the Board of Directors and senior management,
                    as well as all of the business units involved in social
                    compliance. Publishing the code communicates to all of your
                    stakeholders that social compliance is valued at the highest
                    levels of the company and that the company expects to be
                    scrutinized for its degree of compliance.&nbsp;

                <h2>Core ILO Convention</h2>
                <p>
                    The International Labor Organization (ILO) has adopted
                    standards, referred to as conventions and recommendations,
                    in all of these areas. When a national government ratifies a
                    convention, it is expected to take the necessary measures to
                    ensure that its laws and practices conform to the provisions
                    of the convention. The country is also expected to report to
                    the ILO periodically on its implementation of each
                    convention it has ratified. The ILO&rsquo;s core labor
                    standards are set forth in the Declaration on{" "}

                    regardless of whether the government has ratified the
                    corresponding convention or not. Governments that have not
                    ratified the corresponding conventions must periodically
                    report to the ILO on the realization of those rights.

                        Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy
                    </a>
                    , adopted in 1977 states that, although ILO conventions are
                    designed for governments, the underlying principles in them
                    can and should be applied by companies.Today, most
                    companies, industries and multi-industry coalitions with
                    codes base their labor standards on the ILO conventions. In
                    cases where national laws set lower standards than the ILO
                    conventions&mdash;for example, with respect to the minimum
                    age for work&mdash;companies should incorporate the ILO
                    standard into their codes. Where national laws are equal to
                    or more stringent than ILO standards, the code should meet
                    or exceed national laws.
