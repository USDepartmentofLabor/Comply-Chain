                <h1>What Makes a Good Code of Conduct?</h1>
                <p>
                    Codes take nearly as many forms and formats as there are companies. Some codes are stand-alone documents, while others 
                    are presented within broader statements of company mission, values, or policies. Some are included in supplier guidance 
                    documents that include other requirements, such as product quality. Increasingly, companies are including code of conduct 
                    language in multiple documents, as social compliance considerations become more interwoven within corporate strategy across 
                    business units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some code documents are very general&mdash;merely laying out the broad areas of compliance&mdash;while others are much more 
                    detailed. In either case, the code typically is a foundation for more detailed guidance for the decision-makers who implement 
                    the social compliance system within the company. For instance, the auditing tools derived from a code are discussed under{" "}

                    A good code of conduct should be a public document and state clearly the actors within the company who are responsible for its development, 
                    oversight, and implementation, which should include the Board of Directors and senior management, as well as all the business units involved 
                    in social compliance. Publishing the code communicates to all your stakeholders that social compliance is valued at the highest levels of the 
                    company and that the company expects to be scrutinized for its degree of compliance. Codes of conduct should also detail links to contractual 
                    controls, supply chain risk reduction, and enforcement mechanisms, such as terminating relationships with suppliers due to violations of child 
                    labor and forced labor violations.

                <p>
                    The International Labor Organization (ILO) is a UN specialized agency that brings together representatives of governments, trade unions, 
                    and employers&rsquo; associations to promote social justice and internationally recognized human and labor rights by setting and supervising 
                    the application of conventions and recommendations, as well as promoting decent work and providing technical support to governments, trade 
                    unions, and employers. The ILO has adopted standards, referred to as conventions and recommendations, in the five categories of Fundamental 
                    Principles and Rights as Work and others. When a national government ratifies a convention, it is expected to take the necessary measures to 
                    ensure that its laws and practices conform to the provisions of the convention. The country is also expected to report to the ILO periodically 
                    on its implementation of each convention it has ratified.
                </p>
                <p>

                    as rights that all governments should ensure are realized, regardless of whether the government has ratified the corresponding convention or not. 
                    Governments that have not ratified the corresponding conventions must periodically report to the ILO on the realization of those rights.

                    The fundamental rights are enshrined in eight ILO conventions and are considered the minimum enabling rights people need to defend and improve

                    </a>
                    , adopted in 1977, states that although ILO conventions are designed for governments, the underlying principles in them can and should be 
                    applied by companies. Today, most companies, industries, and multi-industry coalitions with codes base their labor standards on the ILO 
                    conventions. In cases where national laws set lower standards than the ILO conventions&mdash;for example, with respect to the minimum age 
                    for work&mdash;companies should incorporate the ILO standard into their codes. Where national laws are equal to or more stringent than ILO 
                    standards, the code should meet or exceed national laws.
