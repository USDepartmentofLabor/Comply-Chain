                    In Cambodia, community volunteers are often the first line
                    of defense in identifying children at risk of child labor.
                    From 2012-2016, the U.S. Department of Labor funded a

                    project created local-level child labor monitoring systems
                    (CLMS) in target communities. The CLMS is implemented by the
                    existing child protection mechanism, Commune Councils on
                    Women and Children, and is supplemented by village-level
                    volunteer monitors who are trained by the project. These
                    monitors track vulnerable children in the community, assess
                    whether they are involved in or at risk of involvement in
                    child labor, and take action to help children get the social
                    services they need. Monitors also raise awareness about the
                    benefits of education and track children&rsquo;s school
                    attendance through meetings with teachers and home visits.

                A CLMS is a time-intensive and resource-intensive approach to
                monitoring that requires extensive engagement at the community
                level. A key advantage is that it is a participatory approach
                that involves all appropriate stakeholders from the outset and
                ensures that all interactions with children&mdash;from
                identification to remediation&mdash;are carried out in a
                culturally appropriate manner.
