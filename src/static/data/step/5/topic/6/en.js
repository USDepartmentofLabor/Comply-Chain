                <h1>Joining an Existing Code</h1>
                <p>
                    In certain industries, groups of companies have already come
                    together to develop joint social compliance systems that
                    individual companies can adopt by joining the group. In most
                    cases these groups either have a code of conduct or are in
                    the process of developing one together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are both advantages and disadvantages associated with
                    industry codes. On the positive side, they capitalize on the
                    experiences and ideas of multiple companies and pool
                    resources to minimize overall effort and time spent on code
                    development. In addition, in industries such as apparel
                    where many brands tend to share suppliers, a single
                    agreed-upon code ensures that individual suppliers do not
                    undergo numerous audits under diverging codes and can focus
                    on improving compliance with a clear set of standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the negative side, in the course of code development any
                    member company may have to make compromises on certain
                    provisions. As a company, it is important to understand your
                    supply chain and its risks and challenges before making a
                    decision about joining a group code, in order to ensure that
                    the group code makes strong policy commitments in the areas
                    that are most important and salient to your business.
