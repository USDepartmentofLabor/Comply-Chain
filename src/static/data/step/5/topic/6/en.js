                <h1>Join an Existing Code</h1>
                <p>In certain industries, groups of companies have already come together to develop joint social compliance systems that individual companies can adopt by joining the group. In most cases, these groups either have a code of conduct or are in the process of developing one together.</p>
                <p>Industry codes capitalize on the experiences and ideas of multiple companies and pool resources to minimize overall effort and time spent on code development. In addition, in industries such as apparel where many brands tend to share suppliers, a single code ensures that individual suppliers do not undergo numerous audits under diverging codes and can focus on improving compliance with a clear set of standards.</p>
                <p>During code development, any member company may have to make compromises on certain provisions. It is important to understand your own supply chain and its risks and challenges before deciding to join a group code to ensure that the group code makes strong policy commitments in the areas that are most important and salient to your business.</p>
                <p>Examples of industry codes include the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-commitment-environmental-social-responsibility">Solar Industry Co</a>mmitment to Environmental &amp; Social Responsibility and accompanying <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-supply-chain-traceability-protocol">Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol</a> as developed by the Solar Energy Industry Association*; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bettercotton.org/what-we-do/defining-better-our-standard/">Better Cotton Initiative&rsquo;s* Principles and Criteria</a> for companies throughout the cotton supply chain; the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.responsiblebusiness.org/code-of-conduct/">Responsible Business Alliance</a>* for electronics companies; the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.bonsucro.com/en/production-standard/">Bonsucro* Production Standard</a> for companies in the sugarcane supply chain; and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ethicaltrade.org/eti-base-code">Ethical Trading Initiative&rsquo;s* Base Code</a> for companies in a variety of industries.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>There are also industry groups that do not require member adherence to a specific code but that have developed general policy statements and statements of commitment for members to adopt. Examples include the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.aiag.org/corporate-responsibility/supply-chain-sustainability">Automotive Industry Action Group</a>* and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Guidance-on-the-Priority-Industry-Principles.pdf">Consumer Goods Forum&rsquo;s* Guidance on the Priority Industry Principles</a> on forced labor.</p>
                <p>Similarly, there are multilateral and multi-stakeholder groups that have developed guidance for a particular product or line of products. Examples include: (1) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/oecd-due-diligence-guidance-for-responsible-supply-chains-of-minerals-from-conflict-affected-and-high-risk-areas/supplement-on-tin-tantalum-and-tungsten_9789264185050-4-en#page1">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas Supplement on Tin, Tantalum and Tungsten</a>; (2) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/responsible-supply-chains-textile-garment-sector.htm">OECD Due Diligence For Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector</a>; (3) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/rbc-agriculture-supply-chains.htm">OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains</a>; and (4) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/Practical-actions-for-worst-forms-of-child-labour-mining-sector.pdf">OECD Practical Actions for Companies to Identify and Address the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Mineral Supply Chains</a>.</p>
                <p>It is both increasingly common and beneficial for companies to require that their subcontractors and suppliers adhere to their code of conduct or a relevant industry code. Verit&eacute;&rsquo;s* Responsible Sourcing Tool contains a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.responsiblesourcingtool.org/vendoragreement">Sample Vendor Agreement</a> to supplement contracts and agreements between a company and its subcontractors or suppliers in the area of code of conduct communication and compliance, including in areas of self-assessment and improvement programs designed to achieve code compliance.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>On December 2, 2010, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) announced that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup, the quadrennial international men&rsquo;s football championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA. As is the case with other mega sporting events like the Olympics, the right to host the 2022 World Cup also came with an obligation to produce the infrastructure necessary to host a world-class event. This would include infrastructure to support an estimated 1.5 million visitors, seven new stadiums, and major upgrades to increase the capacity of an existing stadium.</p>
                    <p>Labor rights activists were immediately alarmed by the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a country with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/06/12/building-better-world-cup/protecting-migrant-workers-qatar-ahead-fifa-2022">a history of labor abuse</a>s and a workforce composed almost entirely of migrant workers. Serious labor issues included the kafala system, which made it illegal for migrant workers to change jobs or leave the country without their employer&rsquo;s permission, as well as wage theft, poor working conditions, exploitative recruitment practices, and lack of a minimum wage. Hosting the World Cup for a small country like Qatar would necessitate massive infrastructure projects affecting hundreds of thousands of vulnerable workers&mdash;in one of the world&rsquo;s most heat-deadly countries. As work began on new roadways, stadiums, and housing developments,high-profile reporting ongoing labor abuses led Qatar and the international labor community to search for solutions.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Pressure from governments, human rights and labor organizations, and workers led one French concessions and construction company operating in Qatar, VINCI SA, and its Qatari subsidiary QDVC SA to enter into a framework agreement with global union federation Building and Woodworkers&rsquo; International (BWI). The agreement includes commitments toward improving labor migration and recruitment, living and working conditions, grievance mechanisms, and subcontractor and co-contractor practices on worker&rsquo;s rights. In addition, the parties agreed on a monitoring framework. The agreement marks the first time that BWI has created a framework specific to a single country, and the first agreement of its kind in Qatar.</p>
                    <p>Entering into the agreement with BWI gave QDVC existing standards based on international human rights and best practices. For example, the agreement stipulates that QDVC&rsquo;s recruitment process be free of charge; workers are allowed paid holidays, medical, and emergency leave; and worker accommodations are safe and functional. On the monitoring side, the agreement calls for a reference group to oversee the implementation of the agreement, establishes an early warning process, and stipulates progress reports to be reviewed by the reference group. The reference group conducted a joint audit in January 2019 and publicly published its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vinci.com/publi/vinci/2019-01-BWI-QDVC-VINCI-Joint-Audit-Report-En.pdf">results.</a> The audit found that QDVC had successfully implemented reforms such as issuing no-objection certificates allowing workers to switch jobs as they please, paying all costs associated with recruitment, and maintaining a system for worker complaints. It also made recommendations for further protection of workers&rsquo; rights.</p>
                    <p>In joining an agreement based on existing standards, QDVC was able to immediately begin implementing reforms and served as an example for a better construction sector in Qatar. The agreement took place concurrently with other efforts to improve working conditions throughout the country, including one of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/blogs/2019/6/13/bcfo0j8vsgi2hn18pfmbjuj7gutkja">first large-scale studies on migrant worker recruitment fees</a> in the region. Collectively, these efforts represent initial steps towards the dismantling of lopsided employer power and institution of a minimum wage, the first in the Arab world.&nbsp;</p>
