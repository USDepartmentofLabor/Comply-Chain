                    &ldquo;Interviewing a child is necessary in connection with
                    recruitment of young people: a) to assess their age, b) to
                    assess the maturity in connection with ﬁnding out what job
                    the person is able to carry out, c) possible work experience
                    and/or d) if one of the workers is identified to be underage
                    for the type of job/process that the child or young person
                    carries out.

                <em>
                    When interviewing a child that you suspect to be below the
                    minimum required age for the particular type of job or where
                    the child has been engaged in hazardous work, it is
                    important to create a trusting and relaxed atmosphere. It is
                    also important that the conversation takes place in an
                    undisturbed but not too remote and out of sight environment.
                    Essentially, the child must feel as secure as possible.

                    There must always be two adults present at the interview at
                    all times. An adult must not spend excessive time alone with
                    children away from others in order not to create unnecessary
                    worry for the child and create a basis for suspicion of
                    inappropriate or threatening behavior and abuse.
