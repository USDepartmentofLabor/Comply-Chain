            <h1>Steps in an Audit</h1>
            <p>
                An audit typically consists of several steps, listed
                below.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Arrival at the worksite</h2>
                    <p>
                        Company practice varies in terms of whether worksites
                        are notified in advance of an audit (an &ldquo;announced
                        audit&rdquo;). However, best practice in this area
                        normally is <strong>unannounced</strong> audits. No one
                        at the worksite should be notified in advance that the
                        audit team will visit on a particular day.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Opening meeting with management</h2>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the opening meeting is to explain the
                        audit process to the worksite managers, including the
                        portions in which management is or is not requested to
                        participate. This is also the time for the team to
                        request the documentation needed for the audit;
                        management may need some time to assemble those
                        documents after the meeting.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Walk-through of the worksite</h2>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the walk-through is to observe conditions
                        in the factory and any associated locations such as
                        cafeterias and dormitories. This allows the audit team
                        to get a sense of any discernible social compliance
                        concerns; for instance, the auditors may observe workers
                        that appear young, possibly below the minimum age. The
                        team should observe, but not disrupt, the flow of work
                        in the factory. Auditors may choose to speak with
                        workers briefly, but not in a manner that would
                        interrupt their work or put the workers in any jeopardy.
                        The walk-through is also a good time to examine safety
                        equipment, emergency exits and timekeeping systems.

                        a medical examination prior to employment may help to
                        indicate the person&rsquo;s true age and also to verify
                        the physical aptitude for the work. Care should always

                        employers can hold interviews with employees and
                        applicants who appear to be below the minimum age
                        required for work to obtain further information.

                        school enrolment certificates can be a good source of

                    Local indicators may also be helpful in countries where the
                    challenge is that the worker may not know the precise year
                    in which he or she was born. For example, in some Asian
                    countries children do not know their precise year of birth
                    but they know the animal year (Year of the Monkey, etc.). A
                    person might know that their birth is related to some major
                    historical event, such as independence or the start or end
                    of a war, or a significant anniversary. You may wish to
                    check what are some local key events or means of marking
                    time in the country of operation which you could use in
                    interviews with workers where you may have doubts about
                    their age.

                    <h2>Worker interviews</h2>
                    <p>
                        The team should select a cross-section of workers to
                        interview. The selected workers should represent the
                        full diversity of the workplace, and include (as
                        applicable) men and women, migrant workers and local
                        workers, workers on different shifts, workers performing
                        different tasks, members of various production teams,
                        etc. If there are young persons in the facility, a
                        representative group should be interviewed using
                        age-sensitive interview techniques.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interviews may be conducted individually or in groups,
                        and typically are conducted both inside and outside the
                        facility. Particularly in cases where there are
                        indications of egregious violations about which
                        employees may hesitate to discuss at work, auditors may
                        need to make time to speak with workers outside work
                        hours and away from the worksite. Auditors should use
                        their audit tools to ensure that they ask workers a
                        comprehensive set of questions. They also should collect
                        copies of paystubs from workers in order to compare them
                        to management-provided payment records.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interviews also provide workers a chance to voice any
                        other concerns they may have. Workers should be ensured
                        that all responses are confidential and are never shared
                        with management. Your contract with suppliers should
                        include a clause on non-retaliation against workers for
                        participating in an audit; participation in an audit
                        should carry the same worker protections as any
                        grievance mechanism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a trade union is present in the facility, a
                        representative should be interviewed. In the absence of
                        a trade union or other worker representative
                        organization, auditors should attempt to reach out to
                        local worker advocacy groups.

                        resources personnel, production supervisors and others.
                        Audit tools should be used to ensure that managers are
                        asked a comprehensive set of questions.

                        For companies with significant numbers of migrant and
                        contract workers in their supply chains, there is an
                        increasing movement toward interviewing labor recruiters
                        and brokers as part of the audit process. Gaining access
                        to recruiters or brokers for interviews can be a
                        challenge, and is likely to require the supplier&rsquo;s

                    <h2>Closing meeting with management</h2>
                    <p>
                        The closing meeting is a time to report to management
                        any code violations found in the facility. Some
                        companies use the closing meeting as a time to request
                        management proposals to remediate problems or to work
                        with management on a corrective action plan (CAP). Other
                        companies use the closing meeting as a time to discuss
                        issues with management, but develop formal CAPs after
                        the audit is complete and the full team has reviewed the
                        audit report.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Report preparation</h2>
                    <p>The audit team prepares a full report of the audit.</p>
                    <p>
                        The length of an audit depends on the size of the
                        worksite. Most audits take one to two days, but they
                        can, and companies should invest in, longer audits if
                        the worksite and workforce are large and/or if
                        significant violations are found that require time to
                        investigate. Audits triggered by a grievance or
                        whistleblower complaint may take longer to investigate,
                        particularly if they require intervention by law
                        enforcement authorities.
