                <p>
                    The scope and coverage of a code should match the scope and
                    coverage of the compliance system overall. If a company
                    chooses to develop its own code instead of joining an
                    existing one, it is important to first familiarize yourself
                    with good practices in code development. For instance, the
                    process should be transparent and allow for input from a
                    wide variety of stakeholders, including workers and their
                    representatives.&nbsp;

                        Identifying affected stakeholders and providing them
                        opportunities to participate

                    <li>
                        Having public consultations and ensuring a balance of
                        interests
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making the standard publicly available and reviewing it
                        on a regular basis

                        , which identify specific standards for each code
                        element. In June 2011 the FLA Board of Directors
                        approved significant enhancements to the Workplace Code
                        of Conduct and Compliance Benchmarks. Six out of nine
                        elements of the adopted code were either newly created
                        or revised, in areas ranging from employment relations,
                        hours of work and compensation to health, safety and
                        environment. The revised code was developed over a
                        two-year period through a process that sought
                        suggestions from a broad range of stakeholders and was
                        adopted by a board that includes equal representation
                        from companies, NGOs and university members.&nbsp;
