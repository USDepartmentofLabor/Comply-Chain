                <p>
                    The hazardous work referred to in ILO Convention 182 Article
                    3(d) &ldquo;shall be determined by national laws or
                    regulations or by the competent authority, after

                    concerned, taking into consideration relevant international
                    standards&hellip;&rdquo; [ILO Convention 182, Article 4]. As
                    this suggests, forms of work identified as
                    &ldquo;hazardous&rdquo; for children [Article 3(d)] may vary
                    from country to country.&nbsp;Countries develop their own
                    lists of hazardous work prohibited to all children under age
                    18. ILO Recommendation No. 190, which accompanies ILO
                    Convention 182, gives additional guidance on identifying
                    &ldquo;hazardous work.&rdquo; ILO Recommendation No. 190
                    states in Section II, Paragraph 3 that &ldquo;[i]n
                    determining the types of work referred to under Article 3(d)
                    of the Convention [ILO Convention 182], and in identifying
                    where they exist, consideration should be given, inter alia
                    to:

                <h2>Forced Labor / Trafficking in Persons</h2>
                <p>
                    All codes of conduct should include provisions prohibiting
                    forced labor and trafficking in persons. Forced labor and
                    trafficking are closely related and in some instances
                    overlapping phenomena, and these issues are often combined
                    into one category in a code of conduct.

                    In recent years, as companies have learned more about the
                    nature of forced labor and the forms it takes in supply
                    chains, they have begun integrating new provisions into
                    codes of conduct. Examples include prohibitions on worker
                    payment of recruitment fees, and requirements for suppliers
                    to do &ldquo;direct hiring&rdquo; or &ldquo;direct
                    employment&rdquo; of workers. A 2016 Hewlett Packard
                    Enterprise* policy document explains the risk-based reasons
                    why the company chose to move to a &ldquo;direct
                    employment&rdquo; policy.

                    <p>
                        &ldquo;Based on independent research and audit results,
                        foreign migrant workers who are employed through
                        outsourced employment relationships are often found to
                        be more vulnerable to exploitation than those employed
                        directly by suppliers. While many suppliers undertake
                        extensive monitoring of the recruitment agents employing
                        and managing their workers, many violations remain
                        difficult to detect and address. Until there are
                        significant structural reforms to the recruitment agent
                        systems in both sending and receiving countries we
                        believe that direct employment by suppliers is necessary
                        to offer greater protections to foreign migrant workers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means that with respect to HP suppliers, all
                        foreign migrant workers must be employed and paid
                        directly by the supplier, not by agents, sub-agents, or
                        third parties. Recognizing that many suppliers rely on
                        recruitment agents, at least in part, to handle on-site
                        management of foreign migrant workers, there will be a
                        need for a transition period to move all new and
                        existing foreign migrant workers to direct
                        employment.&rdquo;

                        A supply chain Code of Conduct establishes basic
                        performance expectations for subcontractors, suppliers
                        and agents. It is important that a company&rsquo;s
                        sourcing policy or Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits
                        human trafficking and sets out protections for workers.
                        The sample provisions below can be used by any company,
                        including federal contractors and their subcontractors,
                        as they consider how best to create, strengthen or
                        revise their own supply chain policies.

                        fees, use only trained employees, and do not engage in
                        fraudulent recruitment practices that place workers at
                        risk for human trafficking and sexual exploitation.
