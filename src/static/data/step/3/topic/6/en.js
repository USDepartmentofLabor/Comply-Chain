                    <strong>Certification Programs</strong>
                </h1>
                <p><strong>Certification programs</strong> certify products or processes using established sets of standards; some of them confer a label on certified products to communicate to consumers that the product was produced under certain conditions.</p>
                <p>Some certification programs include child labor, forced labor, and other labor issues in their certification standards. For example, the Fair Trade program is primarily aimed at ensuring a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; price for producers at the bottom of the supply chain, but producers must also meet child labor, forced labor, and other labor standards in order to earn the Fair Trade certification. For more information, see the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fairtrade.net/act/information-and-training">Fairtrade International</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fairtradecertified.org/">Fair Trade Certified</a> toolkits.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Other certification programs focus on environmental sustainability but also include social compliance criteria including prohibitions on child labor and forced labor. One such program is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/">Rainforest Alliance</a>, whose focus is fighting deforestation, addressing climate change, and ensuring better conditions for rural people; its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/resource-item/whats-in-our-2020-certification-program-assess-and-address/?_ga=2.141806896.348114853.1645024929-1743801321.1645024929">2020 Certification Program</a> includes tackling child labor and forced labor. As Rainforest Alliance notes, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/resource-item/2020-sustainable-agriculture-standard-supply-chain-requirements/">the Sustainable Agriculture Standard&rsquo;s Supply Chain Requirements</a> aim to foster transparency and responsible business practices among companies from farm to shelf, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/resource-item/2020-sustainable-agriculture-standard-farm-requirements/">Farm Requirements</a> are designed to help farmers protect the landscapes where they live and work while offering an enhanced framework to improve their livelihoods and advance the human rights of rural people.</p>
                <p>Another program is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rspo.org/">Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil</a>, whose sustainable palm oil certification includes human rights and social standards, such as child labor, forced labor, and other labor components.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Some certification programs aim to meet the standards of the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.isealalliance.org/">ISEAL) Alliance</a>, an association of organizations that develops guidance on establishment and implementation of sustainability-related standards. The RSPO is one such certification that relies on ISEAL&rsquo;s best practices in its standard-setting process.</p>
                <p>Some certification programs&mdash;and multi-stakeholder initiatives more broadly&mdash;have come under criticism for their governance arrangements, including financing structures, balance of power among members, and mechanisms for holding members accountable, as well as for inadequate or insufficient auditing and inadequate stakeholder outreach. It is therefore important to understand the structure of particular programs in order to assess how they will be viewed by different stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Certification is not where a company&rsquo;s efforts should stop. While certification bodies may include rigorous standards for recertification&mdash;including, but not limited to, annual audits and unannounced inspections&mdash;it is important to continue providing ongoing oversight and protocols to ensure that labor abuses are not occurring in supply chains.</p>

                    <p>For 25 years, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://goodweave.org/">GoodWeave</a> has worked to stop child labor in global supply chains. With more than 170 brand partners and 25 percent of international market share, GoodWeave&rsquo;s market-based model has transformed South Asia&rsquo;s handmade carpet sector, where child labor has dropped from 1 million victims in 1995 to an estimated 200,000 today.</p>
                    
                    <p>GoodWeave encourages market demand for child labor-free certified rugs and home textiles and helps businesses meet that demand. Importers and exporters that wish to be licensed by GoodWeave and earn a consumer-facing GoodWeave label must sign a legally binding contract to abide by GoodWeave&rsquo;s rigorous standard for certifying that products are free from child, forced, and bonded labor. As part of the certification program, companies agree to permit unannounced inspections in their supply chains to monitor for compliance with the standard and ensure that violations are remediated. Companies also pay licensing fees that support GoodWeave&rsquo;s programs for monitoring and inspection of workplaces and the rehabilitation and education of exploited children. GoodWeave is a full member of the ISEAL Alliance, an association widely known as a world leader in establishing best practices for certification standards.</p>
