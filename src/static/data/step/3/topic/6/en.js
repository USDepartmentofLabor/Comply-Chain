                <p>
                    Another option for developing social compliance programs is
                    to explore existing <strong>certification </strong>programs.
                    These programs certify products or processes against
                    established sets of standards; some of them confer a label
                    on certified products in order to directly reach consumers
                    and communicate that the product was produced under certain
                    conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there are few existing certification programs that
                    confer a &ldquo;child labor free&rdquo; or &ldquo;forced
                    labor free&rdquo; label, there are programs that include
                    child labor, forced labor and other labor issues in their
                    certification standards. For example, the Fair Trade program
                    is primarily aimed at ensuring a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; price
                    for producers at the bottom of the supply chain, but
                    producers must also meet child labor, forced labor and other
                    labor standards in order to earn the &ldquo;Fair
                    Trade&rdquo; certification. For more information, see the{" "}

                    At the same time, some certification programs&mdash;and
                    multi-stakeholder initiatives more broadly&mdash;have come
                    under criticism related to governance arrangements, such as
                    certification programs&rsquo; financing structures, balance
                    of power among members and mechanisms for holding members
                    accountable. Other criticism is related to implementation,
                    such as issues around inadequate or insufficient auditing
                    and inadequate stakeholder outreach. It is therefore
                    important to understand the structure of particular programs
                    in order to assess how they will be viewed by different
                    stakeholders.&nbsp;

                        has been working to transform the carpet industry by
                        encouraging market demand for child-labor free rugs and
                        helping businesses to meet that demand. Rug importers
                        and exporters that wish to be licensed by GoodWeave and
                        earn a consumer-facing GoodWeave label must sign a
                        legally binding contract to abide by GoodWeave&rsquo;s
                        rigorous standard for certifying that rugs are free from
                        child labor, forced labor, and bonded labor. As part of
                        the certification program, companies agree to permit
                        unannounced inspections in their supply chains to
                        monitor for compliance with the standard and ensure that
                        violations are remediated. Companies also pay licensing
                        fees that support GoodWeave&rsquo;s programs for
                        monitoring and inspection of workplaces and the
                        rehabilitation and education of exploited children.
