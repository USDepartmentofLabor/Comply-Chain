                    <p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ilo.org/ipec/projects/global/WCMS_390400/lang--en/index.htm">Child Labor Platform</a> (CLP) is a business-led forum that aims to tackle child labor in supply chains. The CLP works to provide concrete solutions for buyers, factory owners, and suppliers by supporting member companies through a comprehensive process of due diligence across tiers. This includes support for embedding strong policies and good business practices, assessing risks, measuring impact, and addressing root causes through meaningful local and global dialogue with governments, employers&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; organizations, and other stakeholders. Since 2012, the CLP has operated as part of the UN Global Compact&rsquo;s Human Rights and Labor Working Group, with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.ioe-emp.org/">International Organisation of Employers (IOE)</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ituc-csi.org/">International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC)</a> serving as co-chairs. In 2015, members of the CLP, including companies from the food and beverage, cosmetics, apparel, telecommunications, and mining sectors, contributed to the production of a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/download.do?type=document&amp;id=27555">Child Labor Guidance Tool for Business</a>, authored by the ILO and the IOE, which serves as a resource for companies to meet the due diligence requirements laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as they pertain to child labor. New businesses and relevant organizations are welcomed into the CLP on an ongoing basis.</p>

                    <p>Launched in June 2018, the International Labor Organization&rsquo;s (ILO) Global Business Network on Forced Labor (GBNFL), supported by initial funding from USDOL and Mars, Inc.,* brings together the ILO with businesses of all sizes and sectors and their networks from around the globe to eradicate forced labor. Operating across all sectors and geographies, ILO GBNFL members work to engage smaller enterprises, develop actionable resources and tools, and devise local solutions that help shape national frameworks to create lasting change. ILO GBNFL members reflect businesses of all sizes and sectors, and employer and business membership organizations including industry trade groups and sectoral associations. Other business-led initiatives with complementary mandates and expertise can join as partners.</p>
                    
                    <p>ILO GBNFL reaches across sectors and geographies to advance the business case for an end to forced labor. The network is aligned with and contributes to other relevant international initiatives, in particular <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.alliance87.org/">Alliance 8.7</a>, the global partnership working to deliver on SDG Target 8.7. ILO GBNFL maintains a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://flbusiness.network/library-publication/">library of resources</a> and has developed a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://flbusiness.network/toolkit-fair-recruitment/story.html">due diligence toolkit for fair recruitment</a> to help companies follow an effective due diligence process when hiring workers from abroad.</p>
