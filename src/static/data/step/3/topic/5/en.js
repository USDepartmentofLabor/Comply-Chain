            <h1>How to Develop a Code</h1>
            <p>
                The scope and coverage of a code should match the scope and
                coverage of the compliance system overall. If a company chooses
                to develop its own code instead of joining an existing one, it
                is important to first familiarize yourself with good practices
                in code development. For instance, the process should be
                transparent and allow for input from a wide variety of
                stakeholders, including workers and their representatives.&nbsp;

                The ISEAL Alliance, a global association for social and

                that outlines the fundamental steps in developing any set of
                standards. According to ISEAL the process should include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Clearly defining the objectives of the standard and
                    justifying its need
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identifying affected stakeholders and providing them
                    opportunities to participate
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having public consultations and ensuring a balance of
                    interests
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making the standard publicly available and reviewing it on a
                    regular basis
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of these principles is more fully elaborated in the ISEAL
                Code of Good Practice.&nbsp;

                    In June 2011 the FLA Board of Directors approved significant
                    enhancements to the Workplace Code of Conduct and Compliance
                    Benchmarks. Six out of nine elements of the adopted code
                    were either newly created or revised, in areas ranging from
                    employment relations, hours of work and compensation to
                    health, safety and environment. The revised code was
                    developed over a two-year period through a process that
                    sought suggestions from a broad range of stakeholders and
                    was adopted by a board that includes equal representation
                    from companies, NGOs and university members.&nbsp;
