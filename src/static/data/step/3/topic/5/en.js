                        The CLP works to provide concrete solutions for buyers, factory owners, and supplies
                        by supporting member companies through a comprehensive process of due diligence across tiers.
                        This includes support for embedding strong policies and good business practices, assessing risks,
                        measuring impact, and addressing root causes through meaningful local and global dialogue with governments,
                        employers’ and workers’ organizations, and other stakeholders.  Since 2012, the CLP has operated as

                        Launched in June 2018, the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Global
                        Business Network on Forced Labor (GBNFL), supported by initial funding from DOL
                        and Mars, Inc.,* brings together the ILO with businesses of all sizes and sectors,
                        and their networks, from around the globe to eradicate forced labor.  Operating across
                        all sectors, and geographies, ILO GBNFL members work to engage smaller enterprises,
                        develop actionable resources and tools, and devise local solutions that help shape
                        national frameworks to create lasting change.  ILO GBNFL members are businesses of all
                        sizes and sectors, as well as employer and business membership organizations including
                        industry trade groups and sectoral associations.  Other business-led initiatives with
                        complementary mandates and expertise can join as partners.
