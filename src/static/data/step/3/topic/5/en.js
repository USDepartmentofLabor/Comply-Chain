                        (CLP) is a business-led forum that aims to tackle child
                        labor in supply chains. The CLP works to identify the
                        obstacles to the implementation of the ILO Conventions
                        on child labor in supply chains and surrounding
                        communities, identify practical ways of overcoming these
                        obstacles, and catalyse collective action. This means
                        carrying out due diligence to identify, prevent,
                        mitigate, remediate, and account for any adverse effects
                        on children&rsquo;s right to be free from child labour
                        that businesses cause, contribute to, or are linked with
                        through their relationships and operations. Since 2012,
                        the CLP has operated as part of the UN Global
