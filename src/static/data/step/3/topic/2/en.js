                <h1>What Can Stakeholders Do?</h1>
                <p>
                There are fruitful ways to collaborate and partner with stakeholders on almost every component of a social compliance system. Below are just a few examples:
                </p>
                <div className="indent-margin">
                    <h2>Code of conduct development</h2>
                    <p className="indent-margin">
                    One of the tenets of developing an effective code of conduct is incorporating input from a broad range of stakeholders. You can seek input during the initial stages of code drafting or maintain a standing group of contributors who provide ideas and feedback on an ongoing basis.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Risk assessment</h2>
                    <p className="indent-margin">
                    Understanding your risks of child labor, forced labor, and other workplace issues is often difficult due to lack of empirical data. Gathering input from a broad range of knowledgeable people is important to get an accurate idea of risks, as well as recommendations for ways to mitigate them. You can also consider supporting data collection and analysis efforts that focus on identifying risks of labor violations in the areas and countries where you source and produce your products.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Training</h2>
                    <p className="indent-margin">
                    A successful social compliance program must make a significant investment in training and capacity-building (See Step 4: Communicate and Train Across Your Supply Chain). Involving stakeholders can have a variety of benefits; for instance, stakeholders can help you ensure that training materials are culturally appropriate. You can find helpful lessons learned and good practices regarding training from USDOLâ€™s <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/projects" target="_blank" >technical assistance</a> projects and other initiatives.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Communication</h2>
                    <p className="indent-margin">
                    Stakeholders can assist in improving communication channels. For example, trade union representatives can receive feedback and concerns from workers at worksites where a union is present, while some civil society groups specialize in setting up grievance mechanisms and other communication channels at non-unionized facilities.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Auditing and independent monitoring/verification</h2>
                    <p className="indent-margin">
                    Some community-based groups are trained to carry out monitoring and independent verification services; others can provide an independent &ldquo;check&rdquo; for internal or external monitors.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Remediation</h2>
                    <p className="indent-margin">
                    Qualified organizations can provide services for workers whose rights were violated, support companies to provide remediation services, or link companies to local resources that can assist workers and remedy rights violations. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Public reporting</h2>
                    <p className="indent-margin">
                    Stakeholders can be instrumental in reviewing or vetting reports and providing feedback. They can also use them to pinpoint areas for improvement.

                        &ldquo;Stakeholder engagement can take many forms. It can be initiated by an organization, business association, or multi-stakeholder initiative, or it can begin as a response by an organization, business association, multi-stakeholder initiative to one or more stakeholders. It can take place in either informal or formal meetings and can follow a wide variety of formats such as individual meetings, conferences, workshops, public hearings, roundtable discussions, advisory committees, regular and structured information and consultation procedures, collective bargaining and web-based forums. Stakeholder engagement should be interactive and is intended to provide opportunities for stakeholders&rsquo; views to be heard. Its essential feature is that it involves two-way communication.&rdquo;

                                    </h2>
                                    <p>Nestl&eacute;* is one of the world&rsquo;s largest purchasers of cocoa, a labor-intensive crop at risk of being produced under conditions of child labor. USDOL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods?tid=All&field_exp_good_target_id=5771&field_exp_exploitation_type_target_id_1=All&items_per_page=10">List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</a> includes cocoa for six West African countries for child labor and two for forced labor.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/our-work/child-forced-labor-trafficking/child-labor-cocoa">C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and Ghana alone produce nearly 60% of the world&rsquo;s cocoa</a>, creating significant social compliance risks for companies like Nestl&eacute; and their suppliers who source cocoa from the region.</p>

                                    <p>Though Nestl&eacute; has implemented policies and programs to address the risk of child labor in cocoa production for many years, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nestlecocoaplan.com/">Nestl&eacute; Cocoa Plan</a> launched in 2009, its understanding of the root causes of child labor began to grow as it increased its stakeholder engagement. In 2012, Nestl&eacute; published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/asset-library/documents/creating%20shared%20value/rural_development/fla_final_cocoa_report.pdf">report by the Fair Labor Association</a>* aimed at mapping stakeholders in Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s cocoa supply chain, mapping Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s supply chain in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, and assessing labor risks with a particular focus on child labor. The study found that the socioeconomic situations of farmers and their families, cultural attitudes and perceptions, issues linked with migration, and factors related to armed conflict were among the root causes driving the risk of child labor. It also helped identify dozens of stakeholders involved in Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s cocoa supply chain in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire. These included governmental and intergovernmental stakeholders, such as the ILO and the C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire Ministry of Labor; non-governmental stakeholders, such as the World Cocoa Foundation* and International Cocoa Initiative (ICI)*; business stakeholders, including Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s first-tier suppliers; and sharecroppers, workers, and village-level committees.</p>

                                    <p>Working in collaboration with many of these stakeholders, including the ICI, Nestl&eacute; launched its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2019-12/nestle-tackling-child-labor-report-2019-en.pdf">Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System (CLMRS)</a> in 2012. The program is aimed at addressing many of the same root causes identified by the Fair Labor Association, including by raising awareness of child labor at the household level and providing a range of prevention and remediation support such as school kits, birth certificates, vocational training, income-generating activities, school meals, and building primary schools. In 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cocoainitiative.org/news/news-partners/fair-labor-association-evaluates-nestles-clmrs-cote-divoire">a&nbsp;social impact assessment</a> of Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s CLMRS found that child labor data monitoring had improved, more producers reported sending children to school, and that awareness of the minimum working age was high, but further programming could continue to raise awareness on hazardous work.&nbsp;</p>
