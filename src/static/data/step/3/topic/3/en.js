                 <p>
                 The list below is not exhaustive, and companies should pay special attention to how local employment structures, specifically the variance of working arrangements and relationships, may inform engagement with various stakeholders. Some typical roles that stakeholders can play are highlighted below:

                    The Role of Government Entities in Social Compliance Systems
                </h2>
                <p>Governments have an obligation to protect the human rights of individuals within their territory or jurisdiction. This includes the duty to protect against human rights and labor rights abuses by third parties, including business enterprises. It is incumbent upon governments to clearly set out the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their territory or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations.</p>
                <p>In meeting these obligations, governments should, among other things, enact and enforce laws requiring businesses to respect human rights and ensure that laws and policies governing the creation and ongoing operation of businesses do not constrain businesses&rsquo; respect for human rights.</p>
                <p>Companies can take a proactive approach to engaging with government entities, both in the United States and internationally, to enhance their social compliance systems. Such engagements can include measures such as:</p>
                <p>Encouraging governments to gather and publish data on child labor, forced labor, and other issues that are useful for <strong> risk assessment. </strong></p>
                <p>Building <strong> communication </strong> channels to allow companies to report labor abuses to authorities that will result in effective remedy for victims.</p>
                <p>Linking the company&rsquo;s <strong> auditing </strong> and/or <strong> independent verification </strong> functions with government law enforcement personnel, when applicable.</p>
                <p>Collaborating with other governments, the private sector, and workers&rsquo; organizations to identify ways to address <strong> root causes </strong> of child and forced labor.</p>
                <p>Negotiating with local authorities to offer <strong> community-based improvements </strong> alongside corporate investment.</p>
                <p>Partnering with unions and governments for public workers projects under <strong> Community Workforce Agreements </strong> &ndash; comprehensive pre-hire collective bargaining units that set basic terms and conditions of employment.</p>

                        also known as the &ldquo;Dirty List&rdquo; (
                        <em>
                            Lista Suja
                        </em>
                        ), of employers who have been found by government inspectors to be subjecting workers to &ldquo;conditions analogous to slavery.&rdquo; Before being added to the list, employers can enter into court orders or Terms of Adjustment in Conduct (TAC), requiring them to pay all wages due to workers and adopt preventive measures. Employers who do not adopt or fail to comply with court orders or TAC are added to the list. Listed companies are banned from acquiring credit from state-owned banks and may be refused credit from some private banks. Violators are kept on the list for 2 years and removed only if they have discontinued use of forced labor and paid all wages due to workers. All government labor inspection data is available to the public.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Dirty List as a tool is complemented by the work of civil society actors like the Institute of the National Pact for the Eradication of Slave Labor* (InPACTO). InPACTO engages the private sector, civil society organizations, multilateral organizations, and government agencies to prevent and eliminate forced labor in supply chains. Companies or business associations that become members of InPACTO commit to cutting commercial ties with individuals or businesses on the Dirty List, monitoring their supply chains, providing training to employees and suppliers on forced labor, and supporting social reintegration programs for workers freed from forced labor, among other actions. More than 40 companies and six business associations are part of InPACTO.

                <p>Once you have identified your stakeholders and understand the potential roles they can play in your social compliance system, you can engage them in dialogue and action. For some companies, identifying key stakeholder groups and getting them involved in specific areas of the social compliance system is the most helpful way to make targeted improvements. This is particularly true for companies that already have some elements of a social compliance system in place but understand that there are specific areas that should be improved.</p>
                <p>For other companies, the best first step in engaging with stakeholders may be linking with existing initiatives, such as multi-stakeholder groups, industry associations, or initiatives or certification programs, if they are available and a good fit given the company&rsquo;s needs and objectives.</p>
