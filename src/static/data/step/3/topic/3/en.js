                    The Role of Government Entities in Social Compliance Systems
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Governments have an obligation to protect the human rights of
                    individuals within their territory and/or jurisdiction. This
                    includes the duty to protect against human rights/labor
                    rights abuses by third parties, including business
                    enterprises. It is incumbent upon governments to clearly set
                    out the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled
                    in their territory/jurisdiction respect human rights
                    throughout their operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In meeting these obligations, governments should, among
                    other things, enact and enforce laws requiring businesses to
                    respect human rights and ensure that laws and policies
                    governing the creation and ongoing operation of businesses
                    do not constrain business respect for human rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies can take a proactive approach to engaging with
                    government entities, both in the US and internationally, to
                    enhance their social compliance systems. Such engagements
                    can include measures such as:

                        child labor, forced labor and other issues that are
                        useful for

                        The Government of Brazil publishes a Register of
                        Employers <em>(</em>
                        <em>Cadastro de Empregadores),</em> also known as the
                        Dirty List (<em>Lista Suja</em>), of employers that have
                        been found by government inspectors to be subjecting
                        workers to &ldquo;conditions analogous to
                        slavery.&rdquo; Before being added to the list,
                        employers can enter into court orders or Terms of
                        Adjustment in Conduct (TAC), requiring them to pay all
                        wages due to workers and adopt preventive measures.
                        Employers who do not adopt or fail to comply with court
                        orders or TAC are added to the list. Listed companies
                        are banned from acquiring credit from state-owned banks
                        and may be refused credit from some private banks.
                        Violators are kept on the list for two years and removed
                        only if they have discontinued use of forced labor and
                        paid all wages due to workers. All government labor
                        inspection data is available to the public.

                        The Dirty List is complemented by a non-governmental
                        organization, the Institute of the National Pact for the
                        Eradication of Slave Labor (InPACTO). InPACTO engages
                        the private sector, civil society organizations,
                        multilateral organizations, and government agencies to
                        prevent and eliminate forced labor in supply chains.
                        Companies or business associations that become members
                        of InPACTO commit to cutting commercial ties with
                        individuals or businesses on the Dirty List; monitoring
                        their supply chains; providing training to employees and
                        suppliers on forced labor; and supporting social
                        reintegration programs for workers freed from forced
                        labor, among other actions. More than 40 companies and
                        six business associations are part of InPACTO.

                <p>Once you have identified your stakeholders and understand the potential
                   roles they can play in your social compliance system, you can begin to
                   target certain groups for engagement.  For some companies, identifying
                   key stakeholder groups and getting them involved in specific areas of the
                   social compliance system is the most helpful way to make targeted improvements.
                   This is particularly true for companies that already have some elements of a
                   social compliance system in place, but understand that there are specific areas that should be improved.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                   For other companies, the best “first step” in engaging with stakeholders may be linking with
                   existing initiatives, such as multi-stakeholder groups, industry associations or
                   initiatives or certification programs if they are available and a good fit given
                   the company’s needs and objectives.</p>
