                <h1>Multi-Stakeholder Groups</h1>
                <p>Some companies establish or join groups comprising multiple stakeholders. There are many benefits to involvement in multi-stakeholder groups, including learning from other companies, leveraging input from non-corporate experts, and providing a safe space to engage collectively with different stakeholders.</p>
                <p>If a company chooses to form a multi-stakeholder group or join an existing one, it is important for the company to apply the same sound management principles to the group as it does to the social compliance system as a whole. The entity should have clear goals and objectives and metrics or performance indicators to assess progress. It should have clear processes in place for decision-making and governance, and these processes and policies should be documented and assessed over time. It should also have defined members with distinct roles and responsibilities and mechanisms to facilitate internal communication among members, and disseminate information about the activities carried out by the multi-stakeholder group.</p>

The RSN works by building coalitions of diverse stakeholders, including companies, investors, human rights advocates, and other civil society organizations to create positive change for brands, consumers, and impacted communities. Currently, RSN is working with partners to prevent and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.sourcingnetwork.org/minerals/">eliminate human rights abuses in the mining of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> and in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.sourcingnetwork.org/the-cotton-pledge">production of cotton in Uzbekistan</a> and Turkmenistan. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_838396/lang--en/index.htm">Although labor abuses still occur, new findings from the ILO released in March 2022</a> noted that Uzbekistan has made progress towards eradicating systemic forced labor and systemic child labor during the 2021 cotton production cycle due in part to these collaborative efforts.</p>

The PPA currently has more than 40 members, including USDOL, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), businesses, industry groups, civil society organizations, and the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (GLR). In 2017, the PPA developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to further support the implementation of supply chain systems in the DRC and GLR and related labor issues and working conditions in line with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. The MOU lays out the PPA governance structure and roles and responsibilities for PPA members. The PPA is led by a Governance Committee comprised of representatives from the U.S. government, businesses, and civil society; it is facilitated by the NGO Resolve.*</p>

                    <p>It is estimated that more than 1.2 million children work in agriculture in the Philippines, a sector recognized as one of the most dangerous for children. Many of these children toil on sugarcane farms, where they work long hours under the heat of the sun, use dangerous tools, carry heavy loads, and spray pesticides on the fields. In response to the Filipino Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) and industry partners&rsquo; desire to more actively tackle the problem, USDOL partnered with the Government of the Philippines to take a more deliberate approach to address children working in sugarcane. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/abk3-leap-livelihoods-education-advocacy">ABK3 LEAP project</a>, funded by ILAB and implemented by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.worldvision.org/">World Vision</a>,* worked to mobilize the private sector and foster partnerships between government, industry, and community stakeholders. These collaborative efforts resulted in a broad range of activities, including the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More than 70 sugar industry institutions and associations established programs to reduce child labor in sugar supply chains.</li>
                        <li>The Sugarcane Industry Foundation, Inc.* (SIFI), which provides support to sugar workers and their families throughout the country, brought together key stakeholders in the sugar industry including planters and millers, major industry federations, and government agencies to draft voluntary codes of conduct to eliminate child labor. These multi-stakeholder groups succeeded in adopting codes of conduct in the three major sugarcane growing provinces, covering the majority of sugar planters and growers in the country.</li>
                        <li>SIFI led advocacy campaigns to raise community awareness about child rights, the importance of education, and the dangers of child labor in the sugarcane sector. SIFI has also played a crucial role in promoting compliance with codes of conduct throughout the industry.</li>
                        <li>The ABK3 LEAP project undertook research to evaluate and identify potential improvements for the Sugar Amelioration Program (SAP), administered by the Philippine Department of Labor and Employment. The SAP utilizes a portion of the lien collected on sugar produced to invest in social programs that benefit sugar workers and their families.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Palm oil is in approximately half of the packaged products we buy at the supermarket. Palm oil is in everything from lipstick to pizza dough to non-dairy creamers and automotive cleaners. It is even used to make biodiesel fuels. While the cultivation of palm has been an important motor of economic development around the globe, including in Southeast Asia, which accounts for more than 85 percent of the world&rsquo;s product, its supply is often tainted by child labor. In Indonesia and Malaysia, for example, children are compelled to work alongside their parents, who often must meet harvest quotas to avoid wage deductions and other penalties. On the plantations, workers are exposed to toxic chemicals and risk injury from carrying heavy loads. Children toiling in the palm oil industry&mdash;whether in Southeast Asia, Africa, or Latin America&mdash;often work long hours and miss school.</p>
                    <p>Since 2013, palm oil producers Agropalma* (Brazil), DAABON* (Colombia), and Musim Mas* (Singapore) have partnered with a set of global brands including Danone,* Ferrero,* and L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al* to form the <a href="http://poig.org/">Palm Oil Innovation Group</a> (POIG), a group that also includes the labor rights NGOs Verit&eacute;* and the Global Labor Justice-International Labor Rights Forum* as well as key environmental watchdogs. Its mission is to build on the advances that the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has made to combat child labor. Companies signing the POIG Charter must certify that all of their palm production conforms to the RSPO standard, as well as that of subsidiaries and third-party suppliers, within 2 years. In addition, POIG members must demonstrate, through published and independent third-party verification, additional social and environmental standards across all operations. This means maintaining a clear policy and compliance system that prohibits child labor, including its worst forms, throughout a member&rsquo;s supply chain. By certifying that operations conform to rigorous standards, POIG creates market recognition for the leading companies in the RSPO and encourages a race to the top. This could not be timelier, given that the global production of palm has doubled in the past decade and is expected to continue to increase rapidly.</p>
