                        the Great Lakes Region of Central Africa. The PPA is
                        currently made up of more than 51 members, including the
                        U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for

                        Palm oil is in approximately half of the packaged
                        products we buy at the supermarket. It is in everything
                        from lipstick to pizza dough, and from non-dairy
                        creamers to automotive cleaners. It is even used to make
                        biodiesel fuels. While the cultivation of palm has been
                        an important motor of economic development around the
                        globe, including in Southeast Asia, which accounts for
                        more than 85 percent of the world&rsquo;s product, the
                        supply is often tainted by child labor. In Indonesia and
                        Malaysia, for example, children are compelled to work
                        alongside their parents, who often must meet harvest
                        quotas to avoid wage deductions and other penalties. On
                        the plantations, they are exposed to toxic chemicals and
                        risk injury from carrying heavy loads. Children toiling
                        in the palm oil industry &ndash; whether in Southeast
                        Asia, Africa, or Latin America &ndash; often work long
                        hours and miss school.

                        and environmental standards across all operations. This
                        means maintaining a clear policy and compliance system
                        that prohibits child labor, including its worst forms,
                        throughout a member&rsquo;s supply chain. By certifying
                        that operations conform to rigorous standards, POIG
                        creates market recognition for the leading companies in
                        the RSPO, and encourages a race to the top. This could
                        not be timelier, given that the global production of
                        palm has doubled in the past decade and is expected to
                        continue to increase rapidly.
