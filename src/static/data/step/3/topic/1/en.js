            <p>
                IFAs, also known as Global Framework Agreements (GFA), differ
                from company codes of conduct in that they are{" "}
                <em>negotiated</em> instruments between multinational
                enterprises and global union federations intended to ensure
                companies commit to respecting a number of core principles
                covering labor relations and working conditions. IFAs vary but
                are based on ILO core labor standards, focusing in particular on
                two broad categories of standards: (a) fundamental principles
                and rights at work (freedom of association, collective
                bargaining, non-discrimination, abolition of forced labor,
                elimination of child labor) and minimum terms and conditions of
                employment (working time, wages, occupational safety and
                health); and (b) other conditions of work: mobility and related
                issues such as training, job security, subcontracting and
                restructuring.&nbsp;

                and apparel retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz, covering 1.6 million
                garment workers. The agreement promotes collective bargaining
                agreements at the company and factory levels, gives workers the
                explicit right to refuse unsafe work, prohibits discrimination
                against worker representatives, and ensures that both management
                and union representatives are trained on employers&rsquo;
                responsibilities, workers&rsquo; rights and obligations,
                industrial relations, collective bargaining agreements and
                peaceful conflict resolution, among other topics. The first IFA
                was signed in 1988 by the French transnational food company BSN
                (renamed Danone in 1994) and the International Union of Food,
                Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied
                Workers&rsquo; Associations (IUF). The parties agreed that the
                IFA would cover all global operations, which as of 2008
                encompassed about 100,000 employees worldwide. The initial
                agreement stated that both parties would promote coordinated
                initiatives on issues including job skills training,
                coordinating information across countries, ensuring gender
                equity and implementing trade union rights as defined in
                specific ILO conventions. In March 2016,{" "}
