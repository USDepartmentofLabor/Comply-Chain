                        The media is playing an increasingly important role in
                        raising awareness among businesses, consumers, and the
                        general public about child labor and forced labor. In
                        recent years, many respected media outlets have
                        generated headlines with their reporting on these
                        issues, including on child labor and debt bondage in the
                        production of Mexican agricultural produce, brutal
                        forced labor on fishing vessels throughout Southeast
                        Asia, bonded labor in India&rsquo;s brick kilns, and
                        fraudulent recruitment practices in construction work in
                        the Middle East, among many others. In many cases,
                        journalists&rsquo; key sources are representatives of
                        civil society organizations who have long fought to
                        bring these issues into the spotlight, and are now
                        finding greater opportunities to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of this research and reporting, we know more
                        about the indigenous families who migrate through
                        Central America harvesting crops, including the elderly
                        and very young children. We understand better the kinds
                        of government laws and policies, such as those seen in
                        some Gulf countries, that can perpetuate forced labor by
                        leaving migrant workers vulnerable to exploitative
                        practices such as passport confiscation by their
                        employers, non-payment of wages, and contract
                        substitution without the worker&rsquo;s consent.

                    <p>
                        We are learning about the deep linkages between forced
                        labor and environmental destruction. In areas where
                        goods are produced illegally or where law enforcement is
                        weak, both people and the environment are at risk
                        &ndash; as in gold mining, an industry with high levels
                        of illicit production, known to contaminate drinking
                        water and land with mercury and cyanide, and where child
                        labor seems to proliferate. We have come to know the
                        bleak stories behind the jubilance of mega-sporting
                        events: stories of workers deceived and paid a pittance
                        to construct awe-inspiring stadiums and toiling in
                        sweatshops to make apparel and merchandise for these
                        events. And we share in the collective abhorrence of the
                        exploitation of fishermen at sea.

                        Whether by shedding a light on opaque tiers of supply
                        chains to increase ethical recruitment and transparent
                        sourcing, or by spurring action to ensure that grievance
                        and remediation mechanisms exist to address labor
                        violations, media coverage can play an important role in
                        contributing to businesses&rsquo; due diligence efforts
                        to prevent and eliminate human rights violations in
