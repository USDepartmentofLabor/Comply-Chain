                        The media is playing an increasingly important role in
                        raising awareness among businesses, consumers, and the
                        general public about child labor and forced labor. In
                        recent years, many respected media outlets have
                        generated headlines with their reporting on these
                        issues, including on child labor and debt bondage in the
                        production of Mexican agricultural produce, brutal
                        forced labor on fishing vessels throughout Southeast
                        Asia, bonded labor in India&rsquo;s brick kilns, and
                        fraudulent recruitment practices in construction work in
                        the Middle East, among many others. In many cases,
                        journalists&rsquo; key sources are representatives of
                        civil society organizations who have long fought to
                        bring these issues into the spotlight, and are now
                        finding greater opportunities to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of this research and reporting, we know more
                        about the indigenous families who migrate through
                        Central America harvesting crops, including the elderly
                        and very young children. We understand better the kinds
                        of government laws and policies, such as those seen in
                        some Gulf countries, that can perpetuate forced labor by
                        leaving migrant workers vulnerable to exploitative
                        practices such as passport confiscation by their
                        employers, non-payment of wages, and contract
                        substitution without the worker&rsquo;s consent.

                    <p>
                        We are learning about the deep linkages between forced
                        labor and environmental destruction. In areas where
                        goods are produced illegally or where law enforcement is
                        weak, both people and the environment are at risk
                        &ndash; as in gold mining, an industry with high levels
                        of illicit production, known to contaminate drinking
                        water and land with mercury and cyanide, and where child
                        labor seems to proliferate. We have come to know the
                        bleak stories behind the jubilance of mega-sporting
                        events: stories of workers deceived and paid a pittance
                        to construct awe-inspiring stadiums and toiling in
                        sweatshops to make apparel and merchandise for these
                        events. And we share in the collective abhorrence of the
                        exploitation of fishermen at sea.

                        Whether by shedding a light on opaque tiers of supply
                        chains to increase ethical recruitment and transparent
                        sourcing, or by spurring action to ensure that grievance
                        and remediation mechanisms exist to address labor
                        violations, media coverage can play an important role in
                        contributing to businesses&rsquo; due diligence efforts
                        to prevent and eliminate human rights violations in
                        their supply chains.

                    Following this initial research, the company should engage
                    relevant stakeholders in gathering additional information
                    about risks. The company should seek input from a range of

                        is the leading international instrument on the issue of
                        maritime law at sea. The Convention distinguishes
                        between different maritime areas&mdash;territorial sea,
                        Exclusive Economic Zones, and the high seas&mdash;and
                        countries&rsquo; ability to regulate activities within
                        each of these. These maritime boundaries add an
                        additional layer of complexity to enforcing labor laws
                        on fishing vessels. The country with its flag on a
                        fishing vessel generally has the responsibility for
                        regulating labor conditions on that vessel. However,
                        when flagging states are unable or unwilling to enforce
                        labor laws on their vessels, workers can become
                        increasingly vulnerable to exploitation. While ships may
                        not change their flags during a voyage, vessels have
                        been known to use so-called flags of convenience, or the
                        flag of a state other than that of the vessel&rsquo;s
                        owner, to avoid financial or regulatory charges in that
                        state, as well as to subject themselves to a
                        state&rsquo;s labor regime they deem beneficial.
                        Enforcement, prosecution, and restitution efforts are
                        further complicated when vessels operate within the
                        territorial jurisdiction of another state.&nbsp;

                        Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing has
                        become an ever- growing problem. IUU fishing depletes
                        global seafood stocks and creates unfair competition
                        within the seafood industry, including by exploiting
                        workers. Governments have been increasing efforts
                        related to IUU fishing. For example, under its IUU
                        regulation, the European Union has issued
                        pre-identifications, better known as &ldquo;yellow
                        cards&rdquo;, to countries that it deems are not doing
                        enough to combat IUU fishing. Issuance of a yellow card
                        initiates a formal dialogue with the government in
                        question regarding corrective measures. The U.S.
                        government is also taking action to address IUU fishing:

                <h2>Migrant Workers</h2>
                <p>
                    Migrants are a category of workers particularly vulnerable
                    to forced labor. In the global economy, millions of workers
                    leave their homes for jobs elsewhere in their own country or
                    in another part of the world. Many migrants in search of
                    jobs place their trust in labor recruiters or brokers to
                    make transportation arrangements and place them in jobs, but
                    many workers find&mdash;too late&mdash;that their wages and
                    employment terms do not match brokers&rsquo; promises. Some
                    migrants incur large debts in the recruitment process, and
                    become trapped in debt bondage when they cannot repay these
                    debts. Cycles of debt bondage can also begin when employers
                    deduct from workers&rsquo; wages for housing, food and other
                    costs, leaving them with little or no take-home pay. Many
                    migrant workers are required to sign contracts in languages
                    they can&rsquo;t read; others have informal employment
                    relationships with no contract at all. Some are required to
                    turn over their identity documents to employers, leaving
                    them without the option to escape abusive or exploitative
                    conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your suppliers use labor brokers to recruit and place
                    migrant labor, you may be at risk for forced labor and
                    trafficking in your supply chains. Recommended resources on

                    If you already have well-established relationships with
                    suppliers and are seeking to assess their existing risks,
                    audit reports done on these suppliers by other companies or
                    groups afford a very useful source of data. Obtaining them

                    When audit reports are not available, there are other ways
                    to gather information on your current suppliers to determine
                    which ones to target for further compliance efforts.
                    Wherever a union exists, it may be a good source of
                    information on labor abuse risk factors. Where there is no
                    union, the supplier may have other grievance or complaint
                    mechanisms in place that could be a source of information.
                    Another option, of course, is to survey all of your
                    suppliers on the key risk factors listed above.
