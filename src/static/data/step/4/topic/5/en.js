                    to an expert, such as a consulting firm, civil society group

                    If you already have well-established relationships with

                    audit reports done on these suppliers by other companies or

                    When audit reports are not available, there are other ways
                    to gather information on your current suppliers to determine
                    which ones to target for further compliance efforts.
                    Wherever a union exists, it may be a good source of
                    information on labor abuse risk factors. Where there is no
                    union, the supplier may have other grievance or complaint
                    mechanisms in place that could be a source of information.
                    Another option, of course, is to survey all of your
                    suppliers on the key risk factors listed above.
