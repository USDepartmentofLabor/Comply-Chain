                <h1>Why Conduct Risk and Impact Assessments?</h1>
                <p>
                    Risk and impact assessments are fundamental elements of the
                    due diligence process. They help identify ways in which you
                    may be causing or contributing to labor rights abuses, as
                    well as areas where you might be at risk of doing so.
                    Assessments can help identify both existing child labor and
                    forced labor in your supply chains, or risks of where in the
                    supply chain these abuses may occur. This allows you to
                    immediately take steps to mitigate or remediate existing
                    problems, or to target your social compliance efforts to
                    those areas of the supply chain with the greatest risks.{" "}

                    As an example, consider a confectionary company that secures sugar
                    from intermediary traders who in turn source the sugar from sugar
                    processors who in turn source that sugar from sugarcane plantations.
                    None of these upstream suppliers may report directly to the company
                    buying the refined sugar for use in its production facilities; however,
                    the company should consider its purchasing and sourcing decisions and the
                    ultimate origins of the various inputs used in the fabrication of company products.
                    Ultimately, if the sugarcane plantation is complicit in forced labor and compels
                    its workforce as such in the production of that sugarcane which is then refined
                    and sold as sugar to the company then the downstream sugar company’s product is a product made in part with forced labor

                    Mineral and resource extraction have also contributed to social conflicts,
                    resulting from, for example, wealth imbalances, unequal distribution of royalties,
                    land-access issues, and increased presence of security forces and firearms, among other concerns.
                    Such disruptions can exasperate vulnerabilities to exploitation, including forced labor and child labor.
                    Although such risks may not be immediately visible within a company’s formal supply chain,
                    they nonetheless are important considerations for businesses to consider in their consultations with communities and stakeholders.
