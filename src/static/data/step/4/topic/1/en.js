                <p>
                    Risk and impact assessments are fundamental elements of the
                    due diligence process. They help identify ways in which you
                    may be causing or contributing to labor rights abuses, as
                    well as areas where you might be at risk of doing so.
                    Assessments can help identify both existing child labor and
                    forced labor in your supply chains, or risks of where in the
                    supply chain these abuses may occur. This allows you to
                    immediately take steps to mitigate or remediate existing
                    problems, or to target your social compliance efforts to
                    those areas of the supply chain with the greatest risks.{" "}
