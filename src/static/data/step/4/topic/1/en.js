                <h1>Why Conduct Risk and Impact Assessments?</h1>
                <p>
                    Risk and impact assessments are fundamental elements of the due diligence process. They help identify ways in which you may be causing or contributing to labor rights abuses as well as areas in which you might be at risk of doing so. Assessments can help identify both existing child labor and forced labor in your supply chains or risks of where in the supply chain these abuses may occur. This allows you to immediately take steps to mitigate or remediate existing problems or to focus your social compliance efforts on those areas of the supply chain with the greatest risks.

                    As an example, consider a confectionary company that secures sugar from intermediary traders who, in turn, source the sugar from sugar processors, who source that sugar from sugarcane plantations. None of these upstream suppliers may report directly to the company buying the refined sugar for use in its production facilities; however, the company should consider its purchasing and sourcing decisions and the ultimate origins of the various inputs used in the fabrication of its products. Ultimately, if the sugarcane plantation is complicit in forced labor and compels its workforce as such in the production of sugarcane, which is then refined and sold as sugar to the company, then the downstream sugar company&rsquo;s product is a product made in part with forced labor.

                    Mineral and resource extraction have also contributed to social conflicts, resulting from, for example, wealth imbalances, unequal distribution of royalties, land-access issues, and increased presence of security forces and firearms, among other concerns. Such disruptions can exacerbate vulnerabilities to exploitation, including forced labor and child labor. Although such risks may not be immediately visible within a company&rsquo;s formal supply chain, they nonetheless are important factors for businesses to consider in their consultations with communities and stakeholders.&nbsp;
