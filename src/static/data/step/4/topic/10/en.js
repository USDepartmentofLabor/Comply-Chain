                <h1>Migrant Workers</h1>
                                <p>
                                    Migrants are a category of workers particularly vulnerable
                                    to forced labor. In the global economy, millions of workers
                                    leave their homes for jobs elsewhere in their own country or
                                    in another part of the world. Many migrants in search of
                                    jobs place their trust in labor recruiters or brokers to
                                    make transportation arrangements and place them in jobs, but
                                    many workers find&mdash;too late&mdash;that their wages and
                                    employment terms do not match brokers&rsquo; promises. Some
                                    migrants incur large debts in the recruitment process, and
                                    become trapped in debt bondage when they cannot repay these
                                    debts. Cycles of debt bondage can also begin when employers
                                    deduct from workers&rsquo; wages for housing, food and other
                                    costs, leaving them with little or no take-home pay. Many
                                    migrant workers are required to sign contracts in languages
                                    they can&rsquo;t read; others have informal employment
                                    relationships with no contract at all. Some are required to
                                    turn over their identity documents to employers, leaving
                                    them without the option to escape abusive or exploitative
                                    conditions.

                                    If your suppliers use labor brokers to recruit and place
                                    migrant labor, you may be at risk for forced labor and
                                    trafficking in your supply chains. Recommended resources on
