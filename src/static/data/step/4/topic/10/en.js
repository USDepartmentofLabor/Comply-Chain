                                <p>
                                    Migrants are a category of workers particularly vulnerable to forced labor.
                                    In the global economy, millions of workers leave their homes for jobs elsewhere
                                    in their own country or in another part of the world.  Many migrants in search
                                    of jobs place their trust in labor recruiters or brokers to make transportation
                                    arrangements and place them in jobs, but many workers find—too late—that their
                                    wages and employment terms do not match brokers’ promises.  Some migrants incur
                                    large debts in the recruitment process, and become trapped in debt bondage when
                                    they cannot repay these debts.  Cycles of debt bondage can also begin when employers
                                    deduct from workers’ wages for housing, food and other costs, leaving them with little
                                    or no take-home pay.  Many migrant workers are required to sign contracts in languages
                                    they can’t read; others have informal employment relationships with no contracts at all.
                                    Some are required to turn over their identity documents to employers, leaving them without
                                    the option to escape abusive or exploitative conditions.

                                    If your suppliers use labor brokers to recruit and place
                                    migrant labor, you may be at risk for forced labor and
                                    trafficking in your supply chains. Recommended resources on
