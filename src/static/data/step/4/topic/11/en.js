                <h1>Social Compliance Data Management</h1>
                <p>
                    Many companies face technical challenges in managing the
                    disparate sets of data gathered and utilized by their
                    different departments or by external consultants. Legal
                    compliance and regulatory data may be managed by one unit,
                    procurement and sourcing by another, human resources by
                    another, and so forth. This can work if managed well, but if
                    not, this fragmentation of data can hurt the company in a
                    number of ways: duplication of effort, which wastes
                    resources; decision-making based on incomplete information,
                    which increases risk; and different units of the company
                    sending opposing messages to suppliers, potentially damaging
                    business relationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Social compliance information is part of this balance. In
                    many companies, social compliance can be difficult to
                    integrate with other operations. But if social compliance
                    data is not effectively used by the company, there are
                    serious potential risks to the company&rsquo;s reputation
                    and relationships with stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your social compliance team should have a comprehensive
                    information system in place. The information system may
                    include one or several integrated databases. Some of these
                    databases may actually belong to other business units, such
                    as a registry of vendors/agencies, suppliers and/or
                    production sites, but it should be shared and utilized
                    effectively by all relevant teams.
