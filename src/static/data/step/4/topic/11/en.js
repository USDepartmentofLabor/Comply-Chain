                <p>
                    <p><h2>What are the Root causes of child labor and Forced labor?</h2></p>
                    A significant number of countries from which manufactured products are increasingly
                    sourced—or where major agricultural commodities are grown—have deeply entrenched social,
                    economic, and governance challenges that perpetuate child labor and forced labor.
                    The most salient of these challenges is poverty.  According to 2015 estimates from the World Bank,
                    736 million people in the developing world live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day.
                    Lack of adult employment with decent wages further exacerbates global poverty.  Poverty is also associated
                    with vulnerabilities beyond low income.  Individuals who are poor lack mechanisms to cope with economic shocks,
                    and suffer disproportionately from poor health, hunger and inadequate access to education and social services.
                    As such, they may be more willing to assume risk to avail themselves of economic opportunities, making them more
                    vulnerable to labor exploitation.  This is particularly true for migrant workers.
                </p>

                              workers within a facility. This heightens

                              Around the world, women and girls face increased risk of labor exploitation,
                              including forced labor and child labor.  Discriminatory laws, policies, and social
                              norms can pose significant barriers to accessing education, training, and professional
                              networks; participation and leadership in trade unions; and entry and advancement in the labor
                              market, including leadership positions in companies.  As a result, women are disproportionately
                              represented in low-paying, insecure jobs, with few labor protections and remedies for labor rights violations.

                              to reduce their vulnerability to labor exploitation and gender-based violence.  It helps artisanal and small-scale
                              female miners, including gold panners, improve their mining practices and comply with legal requirements to mine.
                              In addition, the project partners with female-head of households to set up vegetable gardens, start new businesses,
                              and develop job skills.  The Somos Tesoro project also works with mine owners and management, mining workers, and the
                              Association of Entrepreneur Female Miners* (AEFM) to raise awareness of gender-based violence, set up protocols for
                              grievance mechanisms, and develop support networks to help female miners detect and address discrimination and gender-based violence.
                              Created with support from the Somos Tesoro project, AEFM has more than 65 female miners, including coal miners, brick-makers, engineers,
                              and occupational and safety professionals.  Building on this success, USAID has begun to fund a complementary initiative to strengthen and expand AEFM membership across Colombia.

                                      government, sometimes with the support of employers. In
                                      some cases, unions exist but have direct links to the

                                   represent 4.4 percent of the global workforce. Migrants
                                   are especially vulnerable to labor recruiters and other

                                   insufficient to repay. Cycles of debt bondage can also

                             According to World Bank statistics, approximately 2
                             billion people live in countries affected by violent
                             conflict. Countries plagued by cycles of violence are
                             home to 17 percent of the world&rsquo;s poorest people
                             and this share is expected to rise to nearly 50 percent
                             by 2030. Conflict is a push factor for migration, as
                             workers are often forced to leave home to seek
                             opportunity due to physical and economic devastation, as
                             well as insecurity.

                          Natural disasters and extreme weather, including drought
                          and flooding, are also push factors for migration. The
                          Internal Displacement Monitoring Center estimates that
                          in 2015 alone, approximately 19.2 million people
                          worldwide were displaced by natural disaster, with South
                          and East Asia especially affected by high numbers of
                          displaced persons.

                           Pandemics, like COVID-19, can disrupt supply chains.  The spread
                           of the virus led to sizeable disruptions in existing global supply
                           chains, affecting input procurement and consumer demand.  An extended
                           disruption can lead many companies to suspend operations, as key inputs
                           in a supply chain do not materialize.  In addition, the impact on workers
                           can prove substantial where companies have had to shutter operations.
                           The decreased demand from consumers has led to a decrease in demand for
                           workers at upstream production facilities.  Moreover, the lack of appropriate
                           personal protection equipment (PPE) for some workers who remain on the job may
                           make for a hazardous working environment that endangers their health and safety.
