                <p>
                    Among the external risk factors a company or industry will have to examine are the underlying root causes of child labor and forced labor.

                    A significant number of countries from which manufactured products are increasingly sourced—or where major agricultural commodities are grown—have deeply entrenched social,
                    economic and governance challenges that perpetuate child labor and forced labor.
                    The most salient of these challenges is poverty, which also underlies many others.
                    According to 2013 estimates from the World Bank, …  to assume risk to avail themselves of economic opportunities,
                     making them more vulnerable to labor exploitation.
                    This is particularly true for migrant workers.

                                      government, sometimes with the support of employers. In
                                      some cases, unions exist but have direct links to the
                                      government. An absence of effective, independent trade
                                      unions hampers collective bargaining and thus

                                As discussed throughout this toolkit, migrant workers
                                   represent 4.4 percent of the global workforce. Migrants
                                   are especially vulnerable to labor recruiters and other
                                   intermediaries, organized crime syndicates, and
                                   employers offering false contract terms and other
                                   fraudulent schemes. Many migrants pay fees to such
                                   recruiters or intermediaries and become trapped in debt
                                   bondage: cyclical debt, often including unreasonable
                                   interest or other terms that their wages are
                                   insufficient to repay. Cycles of debt bondage can also
                                   occur when employers deduct from workers' wages for
                                   housing, food and other costs, leaving them with little
                                   or no take-home pay. Migrants can also be especially
                                   vulnerable to confinement in workplaces, including
                                   through employer retention of their identity documents
                                   and/or various forms of physical and/or psychological

                          Natural disasters and extreme weather, including drought
                          and flooding, are also push factors for migration. The
                          Internal Displacement Monitoring Center estimates that
                          in 2015 alone, approximately 19.2 million people
                          worldwide were displaced by natural disaster, with South
                          and East Asia especially affected by high numbers of
                          displaced persons.
