                    What are the root causes of child labor and forced labor?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A significant number of countries from which manufactured products are sourced&mdash;or where major agricultural commodities are grown&mdash;have deeply entrenched social, economic, and governance challenges that perpetuate child labor and forced labor. The most salient of these challenges is{" "}

                    </strong>
                    . According to 2020 estimates from the World Bank, between 703 and 729 million people live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day, and as many as 150 million people may be pushed into extreme poverty due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of adult employment with decent wages further exacerbates global poverty. Poverty is also associated with vulnerabilities beyond low income. Individuals who are poor lack mechanisms to cope with economic shocks and suffer disproportionately from poor health, hunger, and inadequate access to education and social services. As such, they may be more willing to assume risk to avail themselves of economic opportunities, making them more vulnerable to labor exploitation. This is particularly true for migrant workers.

Lack of awareness about good labor practices and workers&rsquo; rights, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, can be compounded by language barriers, particularly where multiple languages are spoken by workers within a facility. This heightens individuals&rsquo; vulnerability to exploitative labor and hinders their capacity to organize and advocate for better working and living conditions.</p>

                            Around the world, women and girls face increased risk of labor exploitation, including forced labor and child labor. Discriminatory laws, policies, and social norms can pose significant barriers to accessing education, training, and professional networks; participation and leadership in trade unions; and entry and advancement in the labor market, including leadership positions in companies. As a result, women are disproportionately represented in low-paying, insecure jobs, with few labor protections and remedies for labor rights violations.

It helps artisanal and small-scale female miners, including gold panners, improve their mining practices and comply with legal requirements to mine. In addition, the project partners with female head of households to set up vegetable gardens, start new businesses, and develop job skills. The <em> Somos Tesoro </em> project also works with mine owners and management, mining workers, and the Association of Entrepreneur Female Miners* (AEFM) to raise awareness of gender-based violence, set up protocols for grievance mechanisms, and develop support networks to help female miners detect and address discrimination and gender-based violence. Created with support from the <em> Somos Tesoro </em> project, AEFM has more than 65 female miners, including coal miners, brickmakers, engineers, and occupational and safety professionals. Building on this success, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has begun to fund a complementary initiative to strengthen and expand AEFM membership across Colombia.</p>

                            In many countries, citizens continue to face barriers to adequate education. Lack of access may be driven by many factors, including the absence of free public education; requirements to pay for books, uniforms, school fees, and other necessities that prevent low-income children from enrolling; an inadequate number of schools and poor education infrastructure; or poor quality of instruction. Children who have limited or non-existent educational opportunities are more likely to enter the workforce. Individuals who are denied educational opportunities in childhood face more restricted employment opportunities as adults and are, therefore, more vulnerable to exploitation.

Migrants are especially vulnerable to labor recruiters and other intermediaries, organized crime syndicates, and employers offering false contract terms and other fraudulent schemes. Many migrants pay fees to recruiters or intermediaries and become trapped in debt bondage or cyclical debt, often including unreasonable interest or other terms that their wages are insufficient to repay. Cycles of debt bondage can also occur when employers deduct from workers’ wages for housing, food, and other costs, leaving them with little or no take-home pay. Migrants can also be especially vulnerable to confinement in workplaces, including through employer retention of their identity documents, threats of deportation,  or other forms of physical and psychological coercion.

                            <p>There is credible evidence of labor and human rights violations perpetrated by state and non-state armed actors in mining areas, including forced labor and worst forms of child labor. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), children are subjected to forced labor in mining of gold, tin ore, tantalum ore, and tungsten. Children are also used in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forcible recruitment or abduction by non-state armed groups, and some are used as tax collectors at mining sites.</p>
                            <p>There is little public information available about whether companies identify risks related to the recruitment and use of children in mining areas. However, in 2017, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.resolve.ngo/site-ppa/default.htm">Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade</a> (PPA)* supported the Coalition of Civil Society Organizations in the Great Lakes Region (COSOC-GL) to raise awareness among the DRC Armed Forces (FARDC) about the importance of demilitarizing mine sites in South Kivu in the DRC. The purpose of this engagement was to reduce incidents of human rights violations, fraud, and mine contraband and strengthen local surveillance and monitoring in support of due diligence for mineral supply chains. The PPA is a multi-stakeholder initiative with 48 members, including leadership from the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development, that promotes responsible sourcing in the Great Lakes Regions.</p>
                            <p><br />In 2021, the International Peace Information Service*, the Project on Resources and Governance at University of California-Los Angeles*, the Sub-Saharan Field Research and Consulting Services*, and Ulula* conducted a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://projectrg.org/due-diligence/">study</a> funded by Apple* that assessed the impact of due diligence programs on mining communities in the eastern DRC. The study found that FARDC has less presence in mining areas covered under due diligence programs while non-security government actors, particularly mining authorities, are more present. While households from areas covered under due diligence programs have more resources to buy food and are likely to own a cellphone, they have similar rates of child labor as mining areas not covered by due diligence programs. The study concluded that due diligence programs are linked with meaningful progress towards responsible sourcing of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas, and more action is required to comprehensively address social compliance risks related to armed groups and child labor.</p>

                        <p className="indent-margin">Pandemics, like COVID-19, can disrupt supply chains. The spread of the virus led to sizeable disruptions in existing global supply chains, affecting input procurement and consumer demand. An extended disruption can lead many companies to suspend operations as key inputs in a supply chain do not materialize. In addition, the impact on workers can prove substantial in situations where companies have had to close operations. In 2020, thousands of migrant workers were <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/publication/wcms_821985.pdf">stranded or involuntarily repatriated</a> when companies shut down their operations in response to COVID-19. Many workers reported working without pay, experienced wage theft, or lost their jobs without warning or severance pay. For example, the readymade garments sector in Bangladesh lost nearly half of its orders from international buyers at the onset of COVID-19, leading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://immap.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iMMAP_COVID-19_Bangladesh_Analysis-Report_022021.pdf">an estimated 1,904 factories to close</a> and costing hundreds of thousands of garments workers their livelihoods.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p className="indent-margin">The decreased demand from consumers for some goods and services led to a decrease in demand for workers at upstream production facilities as purchases for services plummeted at the start of the pandemic with the closure of places like restaurants. At the same time, increased demand for some goods and services, like personal protective equipment and various durable goods, shifted the demand for workers as well. Moreover, the initial lack of appropriate PPE for some workers who remained on the job may have created a hazardous working environment that endangered their health and safety. Ongoing challenges remain to ensure protection for workers from global health crises, including this pandemic.</p>
