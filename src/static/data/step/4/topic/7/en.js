                <h1>Using Risk and Impact Assessment Information </h1>
                <p>Your social compliance team should have an information system to manage its data. All mapping and risk and impact assessment information should be entered systematically into this system and updated on a periodic basis.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Almost every risk and impact assessment exercise in any industry will uncover some risks of labor abuses, and possibly some adverse impacts you have already caused. You will then be faced with decisions about what to do to mitigate or remediate them. In some cases, a risk and impact assessment will identify a specific underlying cause of labor abuses, and stakeholders may suggest ideas for mitigation.</p>
                <p>If your company is exploring sourcing from a new area, your risk and impact assessment should reveal whether the risks are too great. Substantial risk merits strong consideration of whether your sourcing needs can be met elsewhere.</p>
                <p>If you assume the risks, your next step is to find suppliers that will participate in your social compliance program and work with you on continuous improvement. Those commitments should be codified in your contracts with suppliers; many companies require new suppliers to meet defined social compliance benchmarks before they can sell to the company.</p>
                <p>If you are sourcing from an area with high levels of subcontracting, you may choose to limit how much production your suppliers can subcontract to outside entities. This limit must be included in contracts, and in turn monitored and enforced.</p>
                <p>If your risk and impact assessment focuses on your established group of suppliers, your next steps will depend on those suppliers&rsquo; performance. If egregious labor abuses are taking place or are at risk of happening, you should attempt to work with the suppliers to remediate the abuses or improve their policies and processes. If a company does not have sufficient leverage with a supplier to change its behavior, you can attempt to increase your leverage by collaborating with other buyers or by offering capacity-building as an incentive. If the supplier does not respond to these efforts, you should consider terminating your sourcing relationship, while at the same time taking into account the impacts on workers of ending the relationship and attempting to mitigate those impacts in the process.<br /><br /></p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>For electronics companies, one of the key identified human rights and labor risks is conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where many of the minerals used to produce electronic products are sourced. The Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which began as the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative, was developed in 2008 by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, now known as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.responsiblebusiness.org/">Responsible Business Alliance</a>,* and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative* to promote responsible mineral sourcing from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. The RMI has designed tools and resources that are used by more than 350 companies in a variety of sectors to monitor their supply chains. The RMI developed the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.conflictfreesourcing.org/conflict-free-smelter-program/">Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP)</a>&mdash;formerly the Conflict-Free Smelters Program&mdash;that helps smelters and refiners validate, through independent third-party audits, their compliance with global standards, such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.</p>

                <p>Your responses to risk and impact assessment information should center around impact on workers. In the early days of social compliance, companies that identified egregious labor abuses or serious risks in their supply chains tended to terminate sourcing immediately from the suppliers in question. Such actions sent a strong message to suppliers about compliance but also had devastating consequences for workers. The issue of &ldquo;responsible disengagement&rdquo; from a supplier is explored in a discussion paper from the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO): <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.somo.nl/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/">Should I stay or should I go? Exploring the role of disengagement in human rights due diligence</a>. The growing consensus in social compliance is toward capacity-building and development of long-term relationships as a way to improve compliance rather than immediate termination because of the negative effects on workers. The following example demonstrates this trend.<br /><br /></p>

                        <strong>Example in Action</strong>:
                        L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al and responsible mica sourcing
                    </h2>
                    <p>Mica is a mineral used in various industries, including in the cosmetics industry, where it provides a glittering effect in a range of products. While L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al sources more than 60 percent of its natural mica from the United States, the rest originates from other countries such as India, where there is a high risk of child labor and unsafe working conditions. In fact, USDOL added mica from India to the 2018 <em>List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</em> based on evidence that children ages 5&ndash;17 are engaged in collecting mica from abandoned mines in India, primarily in illegal mining operations, especially in the major mica-producing states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Rajasthan.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Despite these risks, L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al, which is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and a founding member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.responsible-mica-initiative.com/">Responsible Mica Initiative</a>,* has made a commitment to remain in India and ensure the traceability and transparency of its supply chain. L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al believes that discontinuing the use of Indian mica would not be beneficial to workers or their families and could further exacerbate social and economic challenges. In India, L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al implements a sustainable procurement program that works with a limited number of suppliers who commit to sourcing mica from legal, gated mines, where working conditions and human rights, including the prevention and elimination of child labor, can be monitored. L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al&rsquo;s suppliers in India undergo independent audits to monitor compliance and agree to invest in community-building activities to address the underlying causes of labor violations. By working with local NGOs and other stakeholders, L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.loreal.com/suppliers/our-sustainable-procurement-policy/sustainable-sourcing-mica">aims to create a sustainable mica supply chain</a> and improve the living and working conditions in the region.</p>
                    <p>Aside from India, Madagascar is another major supplier of mica to a number of firms in the global cosmetics industry as well as to other sectors like the automotive sector. USDOL added mica from Madagascar to the 2020 <em>List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</em> for child labor. In Madagascar,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.datocms-assets.com/22233/1623490704-child-labour-in-madagascars-mica-sector-terre-des-hommes.pdf"> a 2019 study</a> estimated that 10,800 children are involved in mining and sorting mica, primarily in the southern provinces of Androy, Anosy, and Ihorombe.</p>

                <p>Capacity-building and relationship-building usually entail some company investment in training and support for suppliers. However, many companies are adopting a model of upfront investment in building capacity of vendors, agents, and suppliers and then holding them responsible for social compliance performance&mdash;a model that can prove cost-effective over the long run. These and other training and communication issues are discussed in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dol.gov/ilab/complychain/steps/4">Step 4: <Link to="/steps/4/" >Communicate and Train Across Your Supply Chains</Link></a>.</p>
                <p>When you invest in a risk and impact assessment and uncover risks and mitigate them, do not forget to communicate about these efforts. Stakeholders who contributed to the risk and impact assessment deserve a &ldquo;feedback loop&rdquo; on how their information was used. If you took action on information that came from an existing complaint process or mechanism, you should report on your actions. You can include information in relevant internal reporting as well, such as performance contracts and reviews as well as in audits and other assessments. Information on your risk and impact assessment and mitigation efforts also belongs in the company&rsquo;s public reports.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Finally, risk and impact assessment activities should be ongoing, and you should update mapping information regularly in your information system. Social compliance risks change over time as the environment evolves and a company&rsquo;s operations change.</p>
                <p>You can learn more about external communication in Step 8: Report Performance and Engagement, as well as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf">Principle 21 of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a>:</p>
                <p>&ldquo;In order to account for how they address their human rights impacts, business enterprises should be prepared to communicate this externally, particularly when concerns are raised by or on behalf of affected stakeholders. Business enterprises whose operations or operating contexts pose risks of severe human rights impacts should report formally on how they address them. In all instances, communications should:</p>
                <ol type="a">
