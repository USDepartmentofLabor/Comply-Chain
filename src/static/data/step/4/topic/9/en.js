            <h1>Key Information Related to Risk and Impact</h1>
            <div>
            <p>Following this initial research, the company should engage relevant stakeholders to gather additional information about risks. The company should seek input from a range of groups and put in place processes that allow for communication across languages and other barriers such as location and cultural differences as well as practical considerations like internet connectivity, safety concerns, or travel challenges.</p>
            <p>There may be situations where consultation with certain stakeholder groups is not possible, or where consultation does not yield all the information you need. In these cases, experts from academic institutions, corporate social responsibility consultancies, and NGOs can be engaged to assist with risk and impact assessment.</p>
            <p>Some companies take the approach of outsourcing the information-gathering function to an expert, such as a consulting firm, civil society group, or academic institution. If you already have well-established relationships with suppliers and are seeking to assess their existing risks, audit reports conducted on these suppliers by other companies or groups afford a very useful source of data. Obtaining these audit reports may require joining a group, such as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sedexglobal.com/">Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX)</a>* <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fairfactories.org/">Fair Factories Clearinghouse</a>,* or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://slconvergence.org/">Social &amp; Labor Convergence</a>*, which provide a platform for sharing information about common suppliers and collaborating on monitoring and remediation efforts.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When audit reports are not available, there are other ways to gather information on your current suppliers to determine which ones to target for further compliance efforts. Key among these options is leveraging the experiences of workers themselves. Wherever a union exists, field grievances or complaints may be a good source of information on labor abuse risk factors. Where there is no union, the supplier may have other grievance or complaint mechanisms in place that could be sources of information.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One example of a worker-driven solution is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ciw-online.org/">Coalition of Imokalee Workers</a>* (CIW). CIW began in the mid 1990s in Florida, where workers employed as seasonal pickers of locally grown tomatoes joined together to protest persistent low pay. Since its founding, this worker-based human rights organization has sought to pioneer &ldquo;the design and development of the Worker-driven Social Responsibility paradigm, a worker-led, market-enforced approach to the protection of human rights in corporate supply chains.&rdquo;. CIW has grown to encompass three broad, interrelated spheres: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fairfoodprogram.org/">The Fair Food Program</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ciw-online.org/slavery/">The Anti-Slavery Campaign</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ciw-online.org/campaign-for-fair-food/">The Campaign for Fair Food</a>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Fair Food Program, in particular, is a partnership between farmworkers, tomato growers in seven U.S. states, and retail buyers including Subway*, Whole Foods*, and Walmart*. In this program, CIW conducts worker-to-worker education sessions and a third party monitor conducts regular audits to ensure compliance with the Fair Food Code of Conduct. Participating buyers pay a small premium, which is passed on to workers in their paychecks. The Fair Food Program has received acclaim for protecting worker rights, increasing worker wages, and benefiting growers and retailers through robust risk management and brand differentiation.</p>
            <p>In addition to partnering with workers, you can survey all your suppliers on key risk factors listed referenced in &ldquo;What Information Are You Seeking?&rdquo;</p>

                                           <p>Child labor and forced labor are used to catch and process fish and seafood in a range of aquatic environments around the world. The isolated nature of work on waters presents a number of challenges to child labor and forced labor law enforcement in fishing and seafood. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> is the leading international instrument on the issue of maritime law at sea. The convention distinguishes between different maritime areas&mdash;territorial sea, Exclusive Economic Zones, and the high seas&mdash;and countries&rsquo; ability to regulate activities within each of these. These maritime boundaries add an additional layer of complexity to enforcing labor laws on fishing vessels. The country with its flag on a fishing vessel generally has the responsibility for regulating labor conditions on that vessel. When flagging states are unable or unwilling to enforce labor laws on their vessels, workers are vulnerable to exploitation. While ships are not permitted to change their flags during a voyage, vessels have been known to use so-called &ldquo;flags of convenience,&rdquo; or the flag of a state other than that of the vessel&rsquo;s owner, to avoid financial or regulatory charges or compliance with a state&rsquo;s labor regime. Enforcement, prosecution, and restitution efforts are further complicated when vessels operate within the territorial jurisdiction of another state.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing evades regulations, undermines fisheries management and conservation, and endangers the world&rsquo;s food supply. It exacerbates exploitative labor practices, which may have a negative impact on wages and working conditions of all fishers. IUU fishing may also involve forced labor, human trafficking, and child labor. Governments have been increasing their efforts to curb IUU fishing. For example, European Union (EU) regulations require countries that export fish to the EU or lend their flags to vessels that import into the EU to meet strict standards for fisheries management. If these standards are not met, the countries may be &ldquo;carded,&rdquo; which means that they could ultimately face exclusion of their fish from the EU market.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>The U.S. government is also taking action to address IUU fishing. In 2019, Congress passed the Maritime SAFE Act. This law created an interagency working group to provide federal agencies with a coordinated framework to counter IUU fishing and authorized a range of agency activities. These activities include building capacity for law enforcement and port security, improving transparency and traceability in the seafood supply chain, promoting the use of technology to counter IUU fishing, and encouraging better information-sharing among agencies and other organizations.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>Prior to the Maritime SAFE Act, a Presidential Task Force on Combating IUU Fishing released an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iuufishing.noaa.gov/Portals/33/noaa_taskforce_report_final.pdf">Action Plan for Implementing Task Force Recommendations</a>, under which the United States is developing a Seafood Traceability Program. This traceability program, known as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/international/seafood-import-monitoring-program">Seafood Import Monitoring Program</a>, or SIMP, requires the U.S. importer of record to provide and report key data&mdash;from the point of harvest to the point of entry into U.S. commerce&mdash;on 13 imported fish and fish products identified as vulnerable IUU fishing and/or seafood fraud. Compliance became effective at the end of 2018. Recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4521/text">proposed legislation</a> in the U.S. would expand SIMP to cover all species, increase data requirements, as well as require use of data collected under SIMP to identify seafood imports at risk of being harvested or produced using forced labor and IUU. U.S. law prohibits the importation of goods made with forced labor.</p>

                                          <p>Certain projects funded by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the successor to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), are classified as &ldquo;Special Consideration&rdquo; based on a screening of labor-related factors.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>&ldquo;Special Consideration projects potentially have heightened adverse project-related social risks associated with the involvement of or impact on Project Affected People including Workers. Projects may be classified as Special Consideration based on an assessment of the severity of possible social risks, and their relevance to a project.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>Key risk factors that are taken into consideration may include:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Industry or sector: labor-intensive industries or sectors that are statistically more likely to infringe upon Labor Rights.</li>
                                                <li>Regional vulnerabilities: projects in countries (i) with a documented history of Labor Rights issues, (ii) having recently experienced conflict associated with Project Affected People, or (iii) with weak or compromised regulatory systems.</li>
                                                <li>Presence of vulnerable groups: (i) utilization or reliance to a large degree on large pools of sub-contracted, unskilled, temporary, and/or migrant Workers, including within the supply chain; (ii) project risks or impacts that fall disproportionately on Project Affected People who, because of their particular circumstances, may be disadvantaged or vulnerable, or (iii) sectors in which there is a high risk for the use of forced labor or child labor.</li>
                                                <li>Significant adverse impacts: (i) projects anticipated to have adverse impacts on a significant numbers of Workers, or (ii) projects that by their nature or footprint could cause or be anticipated to cause (or be complicit in) significant adverse Human Rights impacts.&rdquo;</li>
