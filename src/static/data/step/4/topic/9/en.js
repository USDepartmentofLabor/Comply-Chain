                Following this initial research, the company should engage
                relevant stakeholders in gathering additional information
                about risks. The company should seek input from a range of
                groups, and put in place processes that allow for
                communication across language and other barriers.

                There may be situations where consultation with certain
                stakeholder groups is not possible, or where consultation
                did not yield all of the information you need. In these
                cases, experts from academic institutions, corporate social
                responsibility consultancies and NGOs can be engaged to
                assist with risk and impact assessment.
