                <h1>Assessing and Addressing Root Causes</h1>
                <p>
                    Among the external risk factors a company or industry will
                    have to examine are the underlying root causes of child
                    labor and forced labor.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What are the Root Causes of Child Labor and Forced Labor?
                </h2>
                <p className="indent-margin">
                    A significant number of countries from which manufactured
                    products are increasingly sourced&mdash;or where major
                    agricultural commodities are grown&mdash;have deeply
                    entrenched social, economic and governance challenges that
                    perpetuate child labor and forced labor. The most salient of
                    these challenges is <strong>poverty, </strong>which also
                    underlies many others. According to 2013 estimates from the
                    World Bank, 767 million people in the developing world live
                    in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day. Lack
                    of adult employment with decent wages further exacerbates
                    global poverty. Poverty is also associated with
                    vulnerabilities beyond low income. Individuals who are poor
                    lack mechanisms to cope with economic shocks, and suffer
                    disproportionately from poor health, hunger and inadequate
                    access to education and social services. As such, they may
                    be more willing to assume risk to avail themselves of
                    economic opportunities, making them more vulnerable to labor
                    exploitation. This is particularly true for migrant workers.
                </p>
                <h3>Causes related to poverty</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Lack of awareness about human rights</h4>In many
                        countries, workers may not have access to information
                        enabling them to understand what constitutes child
                        labor, forced labor or other labor abuses. Lack of
                        awareness about good labor practices and workers&rsquo;
                        rights can be compounded by language barriers,
                        particularly where multiple languages are spoken by
                        workers within a facility. This heightens
                        individuals&rsquo; vulnerability to exploitative labor
                        and hinders their capacity to organize and advocate for
                        themselves.
                        <br />

                    <li>
                        <h4>Gender inequality</h4>In many countries, women and
                        girls face additional risks of labor exploitation,
                        including child labor and forced labor. For example,
                        women are often less educated than men of the same
                        socio-economic and cultural background, and social
                        factors may restrict their capacity to communicate with
                        authority figures. These types of inequalities can make
                        women less capable of speaking up to defend their rights
                        as workers.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Causes related to governance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Ineffective or inadequate government resources</h4>
                        Many governments have not enacted strong laws against
                        labor abuse; others may have adequate laws but do not
                        enforce them effectively, or may struggle with
                        inadequate revenues to address social problems. In some
                        countries, government corruption, sometimes with
                        corporate complicity, and weak rule of law allow abusive
                        practices to occur in worksites and go unpunished. Many
                        governments lack effective social protections for their
                        citizens, leaving workers who may be abused without
                        alternative livelihoods or support services.

                    <li>
                        <h4>Lack of access to quality education</h4>
                        In many countries, citizens continue to face barriers to
                        adequate education. Lack of access may be driven by many
                        factors, including the absence of free public education;
                        requirements to pay for books, uniforms and other
                        necessities that prevent low income children from
                        enrolling; an inadequate number of schools and poor
                        education infrastructure; or poor quality instruction.
                        Children who have limited or nonexistent educational
                        opportunities are more likely to enter the workforce.
                        Individuals who are denied educational opportunities in
                        childhood face more restricted employment opportunities
                        as adults and are, therefore, more vulnerable to
                        exploitation.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                            Weak or nonexistent trade unions and other civil
                            society groups
                        </h4>
                        In many countries, trade unions, as well as human rights
                        and other civil society groups, are suppressed by the
                        government, sometimes with the support of employers. In
                        some cases, unions exist but have direct links to the
                        government. An absence of effective, independent trade
                        unions hampers collective bargaining and thus
                        workers&rsquo; ability to effectively advocate for their
                        rights, including fair compensation and safe working
                        conditions. Similarly, human rights or advocacy
                        organizations are often persecuted in countries with
                        weak rule of law which diminishes the viable avenues for
                        workers to seek assistance when they find themselves in
                        situations of extreme exploitation (such as forced labor
                        and human trafficking).

                        <h4>Migration systems</h4>
                        As discussed throughout this toolkit, migrant workers
                        represent 4.4 percent of the global workforce. Migrants
                        are especially vulnerable to labor recruiters and other
                        intermediaries, organized crime syndicates, and
                        employers offering false contract terms and other
                        fraudulent schemes. Many migrants pay fees to such
                        recruiters or intermediaries and become trapped in debt
                        bondage: cyclical debt, often including unreasonable
                        interest or other terms that their wages are
                        insufficient to repay. Cycles of debt bondage can also
                        occur when employers deduct from workers' wages for
                        housing, food and other costs, leaving them with little
                        or no take-home pay. Migrants can also be especially
                        vulnerable to confinement in workplaces, including
                        through employer retention of their identity documents
                        and/or various forms of physical and/or psychological
                        coercion.

                        <h4>Global competition</h4>
                        Even companies and investors with the best intentions
                        face constraints in administering effective social
                        compliance programs.&nbsp;For example, tight margins or
                        short production time requirements may tempt suppliers
                        to evade social compliance requirements. Managing a
                        social compliance program effectively requires
                        commitment and continuous examination of your own
                        actions and their impact on supply chain partners.

                        <h4>Precarious work </h4>
                        In today&rsquo;s economy, employment relationships are
                        increasingly fragmented, with more distant relationships
                        between companies and the hiring, management and firing
                        decisions made in their supply chains. With the
                        increasing informalization of jobs, where workers engage
                        in temporary and subcontracted employment relationships,
                        workers not only receive fewer employer-provided
                        benefits such as healthcare and pensions, and fewer
                        government supports, such as unemployment insurance and
                        social security, but they are likely to be more
                        vulnerable to abuse.

                        <h4>Conflict</h4>
                        According to World Bank statistics, approximately 2
                        billion people live in countries affected by violent
                        conflict. Countries plagued by cycles of violence are
                        home to 17 percent of the world&rsquo;s poorest people
                        and this share is expected to rise to nearly 50 percent
                        by 2030. Conflict is a push factor for migration, as
                        workers are often forced to leave home to seek
                        opportunity due to physical and economic devastation, as
                        well as insecurity.

                        Natural disasters and extreme weather, including drought
                        and flooding, are also push factors for migration. The
                        Internal Displacement Monitoring Center estimates that
                        in 2015 alone, approximately 19.2 million people
                        worldwide were displaced by natural disaster, with South
                        and East Asia especially affected by high numbers of
                        displaced persons.

                    Addressing the Root Causes of Child Labor and Forced Labor

                <p>
                    The achievement of broad, shared goals&mdash;to prepare
                    workers for good jobs, ensure fair compensation and achieve
                    supply chains free of labor abuse&mdash;will continue to be
                    hindered if efforts are not made to address the root causes
                    of child labor and forced labor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary responsibility for protecting human rights rests
                    with governments, both individually and working collectively
                    in the international system. In 2015, the member states of
                    the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals
                    (SDGs), a roadmap for ending poverty, protecting the
                    environment, and promoting peaceful, inclusive, and just
                    societies by 2030. The eighth among these 17 goals is the
                    promotion of &ldquo;inclusive and sustainable economic
                    growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for
                    all.&rdquo; Goal 8 contains a specific target, known as
                    Target 8.7, which calls for taking &ldquo;immediate and
                    effective measures to&hellip; by 2025 end child labor in all
                    its forms.&rdquo; The G20 Labor and Employment Ministers
                    affirmed in May 2017 that G20 member governments have the
                    joint duty, together with private sector partners, to
                    support the attainment of decent working conditions and
                    strengthen compliance with internationally-recognized
                    fundamental worker rights in global supply chains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though governments must take the lead, business, civil
                    society, labor unions and international organizations all
                    have important roles in promoting and supporting such
                    action. Companies&nbsp;have a critical part to play in this
                    effort, including in the following areas:

                        <h3>Wages and benefits</h3> Through investment and job
                        creation, companies already contribute to economic
                        growth and better livelihoods for workers wherever they
                        are operating.&nbsp;Most companies also ensure that
                        their vendors are paying workers at least the minimum
                        wage of the country and complying with all applicable
                        laws or negotiated agreements in relation to worker
                        compensation, such as overtime, paid leave, and other
                        benefits.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In some cases, the minimum wage may not be enough to
                        provide a decent livelihood for workers. In-work
                        benefits to supplement salaries can help enhance
                        workers&rsquo; welfare without a raise in the minimum
                        wage. Some in-work benefits for low-income workers are
                        provided by governments in the form of tax credits and
                        reduced social security obligations. Private companies
                        can also provide benefits through reimbursement of
                        health care costs and provision of transportation and
                        child care. Productivity incentive-based bonuses can
                        also be a benefit&mdash;as long as they can actually be
                        met on a regular basis and inability to meet them does

                        <h3>Building government capacity</h3>
                        Although the responsibility for addressing root causes
                        is that of governments, many lack the political will
                        and/or resources to put in place a legal framework on
                        child labor and forced labor that fully complies with
                        international standards; enforce that framework
                        effectively; ensure effective coordination among all
                        government bodies addressing child and forced labor; and
                        establish adequate policies and programs to target the
                        forms of child and forced labor most prevalent in the
                        country. For example, without adequate laws and
                        enforcement of such laws related to employee wages and
                        hours, workers can find themselves forced to work while
                        waiting weeks or months for their wages due &ndash; a
                        key indicator of forced labor. In countries where
                        governments have the political will to make change, but
                        simply lack adequate resources, companies can have an
                        impact in a variety of ways. For example, compliance
                        programs such as Better Work are designed not only to
                        identify indicators of labor violations, but to work in
                        tandem with labor inspectorates, building their capacity
                        to find and address labor violations. Companies can also
                        work with governments to fund a certain
                        initiative&mdash;such as building a school in a
                        particular community&mdash;in exchange for government
                        provision of related services in the community.

                        <h3>Collaboration with governments</h3>
                        In some cases, governments are actively engaged with
                        industries to address the root causes of child labor and
                        forced labor. For example, the Government of the

                        , which distributes cash bonuses to sugar workers to
                        augment their income, finances socio-economic projects,
                        and provides other benefits, such as death and maternity
                        benefits. The SAP is administered by the Department of
                        Labor and Employment (DOLE) and is financed through the
                        collection of a levy imposed on sugar produced. Since
                        2002, the amount of the levy has been set at
                        approximately $0.15 per 50 kg. bag of sugar. Working
                        closely with DOLE, the Sugar Industry Foundation Inc. is
                        one of the entities charged with delivery of social,
                        educational, and health programs for sugar workers and
                        their families.

                        Acting together, companies can make a significant dent
                        in the complex root causes that underlie child and
                        forced labor. Sharing expertise and solutions makes
                        obvious sense to expand scope and impact and maximize
                        the use of available resources.

                        A company&rsquo;s code of conduct should include the
                        rights to freedom of association and collective
                        bargaining, but in any given workplace there may or may
                        not be a union present. In workplaces where there is no
                        independent union, it is especially important for
                        auditors to look for signs that worker association may
                        be suppressed. If the suppression of worker association
                        is then identified, it should be dealt with through
                        remediation. When a union is present, it is important to
                        include union representatives in your communication and
                        outreach efforts. Ultimately, effective worker
                        organization and engagement are critical elements of any
                        effort to identify and deal with child labor, forced
                        labor and other labor abuses.

                    It may make sense to target philanthropic contributions
                    toward communities in your direct supply chains,
                    particularly those at highest risk for child labor, forced
                    labor and other labor abuses. While such contributions do
                    not substitute for a robust social compliance system, they
                    can assist in helping your company achieve the goals of a
                    social compliance program.

                        predominantly women, or if your workforce includes
                        families migrating together, providing a daycare or
                        early childhood education facility can make a positive
                        difference. In communities where children do not have
                        reliable access to education, you can finance a school
                        or educational facility. In communities with schools but
                        where education quality is low, you can finance training
                        for teachers or funding for better teacher
                        salaries.&nbsp;In communities where quality education is
                        available, you can finance a scholarship program.
                        Vocational training is another avenue to provide
                        adolescents with skills to obtain better jobs.

                        <h3>Livelihood programs</h3>
                        Livelihood programs seek to help the poor attain the
                        necessary competencies and tangible and intangible
                        assets to be able to sustain themselves and their
                        families in the face of various shocks and stresses.
                        Companies can support these programs for workers and
                        their families, contributing to their ability to weather
                        often unpredictable economic environments. Elevating
                        livelihoods of the communities in which you operate can
                        contribute to their growth and stability and, by
                        extension, the growth and stability of your business.

                        <h3>Youth Employment initiatives</h3>
                        In many developing countries, young adults are
                        disproportionately impacted by unemployment. Providing
                        job training and apprenticeship programs that allow
                        youth to &ldquo;earn as they train&rdquo; are critical
                        to expanding a country&rsquo;s human capital and thus
                        future growth potential. By sponsoring these types of
                        programs, a company can prepare young people with the
                        necessary skills to be effective employees, while
                        contributing to broader development objectives.

                        El Salvador, a small country with a long history of
                        civil conflict and instability, is an uncertain
                        operating environment. But League Collegiate
                        Outfitter&rsquo;s El Salvador branch, League Central America
                        (LCA), saw an opportunity to develop a productive
                        enterprise through investing in programs that build the
                        capacity of workers and help tackle poverty and violence
                        in their communities. LCA makes it a priority to hire
                        young workers who would struggle to find work elsewhere,
                        including people with disabilities, former gang members,
                        and those who are vulnerable to joining a gang. Today,
                        rehabilitated gang members make up over 15 percent of
                        the factory&rsquo;s workforce. In addition to decent
                        employment, LCA offers opportunities for youth to
                        participate in a savings and loan program, receive
                        childcare assistance, and further their education,
                        including through high school equivalency classes and
                        English lessons. LCA has found that providing such
                        employment benefits not only empowers vulnerable youth,
                        but also reduces worker turnover and improves
                        efficiencies in factory production.

                        If a company employs a large female workforce or
                        operates in an environment where substantial gender
                        inequalities exist, sponsoring programs that target the
                        specific needs of women can have a positive impact on
                        female workers&rsquo; lives as well as business
                        operations. Women&rsquo;s empowerment programs can take
                        many forms, including skills training, health
                        sensitization, savings groups and education.

                        workers with the foundational and technical skills
                        needed to advance in the workplace. Life skills learning

                        literacy, to general and reproductive health, to problem
                        solving and decision making. These courses are
                        complemented by technical trainings tailored to the
                        specific manufacturing setting. P.A.C.E is currently

                        of life and enhance workplace productivity. Health

                        direct health service provision for workers and their
                        families. These efforts help improve health among
                        workers and their families, which will mitigate their

                        Companies can cooperate with law enforcement to help

                        Low-income workers may have little education with regard
                        to handling their finances.&nbsp;Providing training
                        about basic financial competencies can help workers
                        improve their financial sustainability.&nbsp;This may
                        include training workers on basic savings techniques or
                        helping them understand and access appropriate financial
                        products.

                        <h3>Changing business processes</h3>
                        Sometimes simple changes in processes can make a big
                        difference in workers&rsquo; day-to-day lives. For
                        instance, how and when workers are paid is critical for
                        low-income individuals. Reliable, consistent payment
                        relieves a large strain on workers who may have little
                        or no savings to rely upon and are put at risk when paid
                        late or unpredictably. Workers who are paid on a piece
                        rate basis should fully understand the terms of their
                        compensation. Similarly, employers must ensure that
                        workers fully understand and accept any withholdings
                        from earnings, such as taxes or trade union dues. Job
                        training is also an important way for companies to keep
                        workers invested in their positions while advancing
                        business capacity and productivity.

                        <h3>Developing markets</h3>
                        Many companies sourcing products from the developing
                        world have also begun marketing and selling products in
                        emerging markets. Economic growth in some countries has
                        created large new markets for consumer products. Recent
                        research has made the case for company investment in
                        education, health and livelihoods programs for the
                        poorest segment of these societies, the so-called
                        &ldquo;bottom of the pyramid&rdquo;, in order to
                        encourage the growth of a sustainable consumer base.
