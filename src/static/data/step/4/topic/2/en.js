                <p>
                    Any risk and impact assessment process should begin with a thorough examination of a company&rsquo;s processes and the ways in which it may be causing&mdash;or is at risk of causing&mdash;child and forced labor abuses through its own practices.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, it is widely acknowledged that rush orders and last-minute changes in specifications can cause problems in production facilities with respect to worker hours, working conditions, compensation issues, outsourcing, and risks of forced labor. Similarly, companies may have social compliance systems in place that collect and track data on their suppliers&rsquo; compliance with their code of conduct, yet they continue placing orders with suppliers that have poor compliance records. This sends a signal to suppliers that social compliance does not really matter and negates any incentive to improve performance. The best way to mitigate these impacts is to integrate social compliance within all relevant units of a company. One resource that discusses this issue in depth is{" "}

                    As with assessment of external impacts (see below), this internally focused assessment process should be ongoing, not a one-time exercise. Impacts and risks should be assessed prior to major business decisions or changes in operation and at periodic intervals. It is often useful to engage external experts in assessing a company&rsquo;s internal processes and practices (see <Link to="/steps/2/topic/5" >
                    Risk and Impact Information Gathering
</Link>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If, after examining these processes and practices, you discover abuses that you have already caused or to which you have contributed, you should actively engage in remediation. If you identify risks, these should be mitigated or prevented by engaging in a process of internal change with all relevant actors in the company in close consultation with key stakeholders (see <Link to="/steps/1/" >
                    Step 1: Engage Stakeholders and Partners</Link>).
