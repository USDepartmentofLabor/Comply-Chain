                <h1>Assessing Internal Impacts and Risk Factors</h1>
                <p>
                    Any risk and impact assessment process should begin with a
                    thorough examination of a company&rsquo;s processes and the
                    ways in which you may be causing&mdash;or at risk of
                    causing&mdash;child and forced labor abuse through your own
                    practices.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, it is widely acknowledged that rush orders and
                    last-minute changes in specifications can cause problems in
                    production facilities with respect to worker hours, working
                    conditions, compensation issues, outsourcing, and risks of
                    forced labor. Similarly, companies may have social
                    compliance systems in place that collect and track data on
                    their suppliers&rsquo; compliance with their code of
                    conduct, yet they continue placing orders with the suppliers
                    that have poor compliance records. This sends a signal to
                    suppliers that social compliance does not really matter, and
                    negates any incentive to improve performance. The best way
                    to mitigate these impacts is to integrate social compliance
                    within all relevant units of a company. One resource that
                    discusses this issue in depth is{" "}

                    As with assessment of external impacts (see below), this
                    internally-focused assessment process should be ongoing, not
                    a one-time exercise. Impacts and risks should be assessed
                    prior to major business decisions or changes in operation,
                    and at periodic intervals. It is often useful to engage
                    external experts in such an assessment of a company&rsquo;s
                    internal processes and practices (see Information
                    Gathering).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If, after examining these processes and practices, you
                    discover abuses that you have already caused or to which you
                    have contributed, you should actively engage in remediation.
                    If you identify risks, these should be mitigated or
                    prevented by engaging in a process of internal change with
                    all relevant actors in the company.
