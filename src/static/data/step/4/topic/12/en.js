               <p>
                   The achievement of broad, shared goals&mdash;to prepare
                   workers for good jobs, ensure fair compensation and achieve
                   supply chains free of labor abuse&mdash;will continue to be
                   hindered if efforts are not made to address the root causes
                   of child labor and forced labor.
               </p>
               <p>
                   The primary responsibility for protecting human rights rests
                   with governments, both individually and working collectively
                   in the international system. In 2015, the member states of
                   the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals
                   (SDGs), a roadmap for ending poverty, protecting the
                   environment, and promoting peaceful, inclusive, and just
                   societies by 2030. The eighth among these 17 goals is the
                   promotion of &ldquo;inclusive and sustainable economic
                   growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for
                   all.&rdquo; Goal 8 contains a specific target, known as
                   Target 8.7, which calls for taking &ldquo;immediate and
                   effective measures to&hellip; by 2025 end child labor in all
                   its forms.&rdquo; The G20 Labor and Employment Ministers
                   affirmed in May 2017 that G20 member governments have the
                   joint duty, together with private sector partners, to
                   support the attainment of decent working conditions and
                   strengthen compliance with internationally-recognized
                   fundamental worker rights in global supply chains.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Though governments must take the lead, business, civil
                   society, labor unions and international organizations all
                   have important roles in promoting and supporting such
                   action. Companies&nbsp;have a critical part to play in this
                   effort, including in the following areas:

                         creation, companies already contribute to economic
                         growth and better livelihoods for workers wherever they
                         are operating.&nbsp;Most companies also ensure that
                         their vendors are paying workers at least the minimum
                         wage of the country and complying with all applicable
                         laws or negotiated agreements in relation to worker
                         compensation, such as overtime, paid leave, and other
                         benefits.

                         <br />
                         In some cases, the minimum wage may not be enough to
                         provide a decent livelihood for workers. In-work
                         benefits to supplement salaries can help enhance
                         workers&rsquo; welfare without a raise in the minimum
                         wage. Some in-work benefits for low-income workers are
                         provided by governments in the form of tax credits and
                         reduced social security obligations. Private companies
                         can also provide benefits through reimbursement of
                         health care costs and provision of transportation and
                         child care. Productivity incentive-based bonuses can
                         also be a benefit&mdash;as long as they can actually be
                         met on a regular basis and inability to meet them does
                         not result in excessive hours of work or work hours that
                         are not paid in accordance with legal requirements.

                                 Although the responsibility for addressing root causes
                                is that of governments, many lack the political will
                                and/or resources to put in place a legal framework on
                                child labor and forced labor that fully complies with
                                international standards; enforce that framework
                                effectively; ensure effective coordination among all
                                government bodies addressing child and forced labor; and
                                establish adequate policies and programs to target the
                                forms of child and forced labor most prevalent in the
                                country. For example, without adequate laws and
                                enforcement of such laws related to employee wages and
                                hours, workers can find themselves forced to work while
                                waiting weeks or months for their wages due &ndash; a
                                key indicator of forced labor. In countries where
                                governments have the political will to make change, but
                                simply lack adequate resources, companies can have an
                                impact in a variety of ways. For example, compliance
                                programs such as Better Work are designed not only to
                                identify indicators of labor violations, but to work in
                                tandem with labor inspectorates, building their capacity
                                to find and address labor violations. Companies can also
                                work with governments to fund a certain
                                initiative&mdash;such as building a school in a
                                particular community&mdash;in exchange for government
                                provision of related services in the community.
