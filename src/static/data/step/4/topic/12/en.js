                <h1>Addressing Root Causes</h1>
                <p>The achievement of broad, shared goals&mdash;to prepare workers for good jobs, ensure fair compensation, and achieve supply chains free of labor abuse&mdash;will continue to be hindered if efforts are not made to address the root causes of child labor and forced labor.</p>
                <p>The primary responsibility for protecting human rights rests with governments, both individually and working collectively in the international system. In 2015, the member states of the UN adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a roadmap for ending poverty, protecting the environment, and promoting peaceful, inclusive, and just societies by 2030. The eighth among these 17 goals is the promotion of &ldquo;inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.&rdquo; Goal 8 contains a specific target, known as Target 8.7, which calls for taking &ldquo;immediate and effective measures to&hellip; by 2025 end child labor in all its forms.&rdquo; The G20 Labor and Employment Ministers affirmed in May 2017 that G20 member governments have the joint duty, together with private sector partners, to support the attainment of decent working conditions and strengthen compliance with internationally recognized fundamental worker rights in global supply chains.</p>
                <p>Though governments must take the lead, businesses, civil society, labor unions, and international organizations all have important roles in promoting and supporting such action. Companies have a critical part to play in this effort, including in the following areas:</p>

                       <p>Though companies must ensure that their vendors are paying workers at least the minimum wage of the country and complying with all applicable laws or negotiated agreements in relation to worker compensation, such as overtime, paid leave, and other benefits, the minimum wage may not be enough to provide a decent livelihood for workers in some cases. Worker organizations may bargain for a living wage higher than the legal minimum. In-work benefits to supplement salaries can also enhance workers&rsquo; welfare. Some in-work benefits for low-income workers are provided by governments in the form of tax credits and reduced social security obligations. Private companies can also provide benefits through reimbursement of health care costs and provision of transportation and childcare. Productivity incentive-based bonuses can also be a benefit provided workers can meet productivity targets on a regular basis and without excessive work hours or unpaid overtime.</p>

                              <p>Although the responsibility for addressing root causes is that of governments, many lack the political will and resources to put in place a legal framework on child labor and forced labor that fully complies with international standards; enforce that framework effectively; ensure effective coordination among all government bodies addressing child and forced labor; and establish adequate policies and programs to target the forms of child and forced labor most prevalent in the country. For example, without adequate laws and enforcement of wage and hours laws, workers can find themselves forced to work while waiting weeks or months for owed wages&mdash;a key indicator of forced labor. In countries where governments have the political will to make change, but simply lack adequate resources, companies can have an impact in a variety of ways. Compliance programs such as Better Work are designed not only to identify indicators of labor violations but to work in tandem with labor inspectorates, building their capacity to find and address labor violations. Companies can also work with governments to fund a certain initiative&mdash;such as building a school in a particular community&mdash;in exchange for government provision of related services in the community.</p>

                                         <p>In some cases, governments are actively engaged with industries to address the root causes of child labor and forced labor. For example, the Government of the Philippines implements the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dole.gov.ph/social-amelioration-program-sap-in-the-sugar-industry/">Social Amelioration Program (SAP)</a>, which distributes cash bonuses to sugar workers to augment their income, finances socioeconomic projects, and provides other benefits such as death and maternity benefits. The SAP is administered by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and is financed through the collection of a levy imposed on sugar produced. Working closely with DOLE, the Sugar Industry Foundation Inc. (SIFI) is one of the entities charged with delivery of social, educational, and health programs for sugar workers and their families.</p>

                                       <p>The rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining are core labor standards and should be included in a company&rsquo;s codes of conduct, but unions are not present in all workplaces. In workplaces where there is no independent union, it is especially important for auditors to look for signs that worker organizing and freedom of association may be suppressed. If the suppression of worker organizing and freedom of association is identified, it should be dealt with through remediation. When a union is present, it is important to include union representatives in your communication and outreach efforts. Ultimately, effective worker organization and engagement are critical elements of any effort to identify and deal with child labor, forced labor, and other labor abuses. An example of this partnership is French transnational food company Danone* and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers&rsquo; Associations (IUF)* highlighted in Step 3: Develop a Code of Conduct.</p>

                                      <p>The international labor recruitment industry, which is often murky and under-regulated, is an area of concern for many companies with global operations. Recruiters may commit abuses against workers moving across the globe for job opportunities, including charging excessive fees, withholding passports, and providing misleading information about the nature and type of available jobs. Migrant workers in working in high-risk countries or in high-risk supply chains face the greatest risk, but there are risks to companies as well.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>To address these concerns, companies should put in place adequate safeguards to ensure responsible recruitment of workers. In an effort to provide companies with such guidance, the ILO has released guidance general principles and operational guidelines for fair recruitment and definition of recruitment fees and related costs to help companies establish safeguards as part of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/fair-recruitment/fri/lang--en/index.htm">Fair Recruitment Initiative</a>. As part of this initiative, the ILO has compiled an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ilo.org/gimi/FRI.action">interactive map</a>, which highlights a global view of all the national laws, policies, and regulations that have defined recruitment fees and related costs.</p>
                                        <p>In early 2019, several U.S. government agencies (U.S. Department of Defense, General Services Administration, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration) published a final rule, which <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/12/20/2018-27541/federal-acquisition-regulation-combating-trafficking-in-persons-definition-of-recruitment-fees">defined recruitment fees</a> to further implement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in an effort to reduce the risk of trafficking in persons. Prohibiting contractors from charging employees recruitment fees is a key element in the fight against trafficking in persons.</p>

After a difficult labor dispute in 2009 with one of their factories in Honduras, Fruit of the Loom began engaging key stakeholders including trade unions, labor experts, local Honduran management, and civil society leaders to build an effective framework for future labor-management relations. These efforts resulted in a landmark collective bargaining agreement between Fruit of the Loom and its employees, represented by Central General de Trabajadores (CGT) &ndash; a national trade union center in Honduras. The agreement included ensuring respect for workers&rsquo; freedom of association, wage increases, new benefits such as transportation to and from work and free lunches, and investments in better machinery.&nbsp;</p>
