                <h1>Supply Chain Mapping</h1>
                <p>
                    Companies know who their direct suppliers are and where they
                    are located. However, in many cases, companies source from
                    vendors or agents who do not disclose the factories or other
                    production facilities from which <em>they</em> in turn
                    source. Oftentimes companies may be aware of the first-tier
                    factories and production facilities in their supply chains,
                    but know little or nothing about the practices of second,
                    third and other tiers of suppliers down the line. Companies
                    should know as much as possible about who supplies to
                    them&mdash;at all levels of the supply chain, including
                    producers of raw materials. The more comprehensively a
                    company can map its supply chains, the more accurately it
                    can identify those places along the chain with the greatest
                    risks of labor abuses. It is therefore important to
                    communicate with the company&rsquo;s sourcing and/or supply
                    chain management teams to obtain data about their own supply
                    chains, and if more information is needed, to work closely
                    with them to supplement that data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a company currently does not have access to information
                    about suppliers beyond those from whom it sources directly,
                    consider working with the legal department and/or other
                    appropriate units in the company to create contractual
                    requirements for disclosing comprehensive information about
                    all of the suppliers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Mapping&rdquo; includes knowing not only who your
                    suppliers are (throughout the supply chain), but also where
                    they are located. This information is essential for risk and
                    impact assessment related to legal and regulatory
                    environments, among other things. This exercise may also
                    include maps showing seasonality of production or production
                    cycles throughout the year, as these may be tied to times of
                    greater risk for labor abuses.&nbsp;

                <p>
                    Goods produced using agricultural or mineral commodities can
                    be particularly difficult to trace, since the raw materials
                    are harvested or mined in widely dispersed geographic areas
                    and aggregated or co-mingled early in the supply chain. Some
                    companies and industry coalitions have attempted
                    &ldquo;traceability&rdquo; programs to track certain
                    commodities from a finished product back through the supply
                    chain to their point of origin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be clear, mapping supply chains does not necessarily
                    imply that a company is responsible for all impacts and
                    risks associated with every entity in the chain. As stated

                                This graphic illustrates the various players in
                                a cocoa supply chain, which include farmers;
                                collectors/transporters; processors; exporters;
                                the global market; manufacturers (which may also
                                manufacture other beans); customers; and
                                consumers. The graphic also lists examples of
                                entities and activities that fall into those
                                supply chain categories in two countries:
                                C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and Ghana. In
                                C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, examples of farmers
                                include small, family farms (&gt;750,000);
                                independent operations; and a few cooperatives
                                (where cocoa is &lt;20% of crop). Collectors and
                                transporters include privately-funded operators;
                                and pisteurs, traitants; which have fewer
                                quality linkages. Processors and exporters
                                include various participants, including
                                international companies. This includes those
                                that produce semi-finished goods. In Ghana,
                                examples of farmers include small, family farms
                                (&gt;600,000); independent operations; and a few
                                cooperatives (where cocoa is &lt;10% of crop).
                                The initial purchase of cocoa beans is by
                                licensed buyers (LBCs). The Ghana Cocoa Board
                                (COCOBOD) and affiliated organizations ensure
                                that quality requirements are linked to sales.
                                Processors and exporters in Ghana include
                                COCOBOD and international companies. This
                                includes those that produce semi-finished goods.
                                The graphic lists similar final steps in the
                                process for both countries. Beans and small
                                family farm products are moved into the global
                                market. Manufacturers further manufacture the
                                products. Retail outlets, restaurants and small
                                businesses serve as customers. And consumers are
                                the final customer.&nbsp;

                                    generic import supply chain. The depiction
                                    of a typical retail model supply chain
                                    begins with:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Step One: Product Development. In this
                                        phase, a product concept and supplier
                                        are determined, and a product design is
                                        finalized. This is also when financing
                                        is determined and occurs 5 to 9 months
                                        prior to the in-store date.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Step Two: Order and Production. Here,
                                        item set-up and classification occurs,
                                        and a buyer sends an electronic purchase
                                        order to a vendor, customs broker,
                                        freight forwarder and bank. Factory
                                        selection and pre-production testing is
                                        next, followed by merchandise production
                                        by the factory which checks for quality
                                        assurance and social compliance. This
                                        all occurs 2 to 5 months prior to the
                                        in-store date.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Step Three: Carrier Booking. Here, the
                                        vendor books cargo with a freight
                                        forwarder and delivers cargo to a
                                        terminal or Container Freight Station
                                        (CFS) location. This happens 2 to 4
                                        months prior to the in-store date.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Step Four: Document Processing and
                                        Shipment. The vendor submits entry docs
                                        to the freight forwarder and pays local
                                        charges. The freight forwarder also
                                        sends docs electronically to the broker.
                                        A Forwarders Cargo Receipt (FCR) is
                                        issued to the vendor (which is required
                                        for the vendor to receive payment). The
                                        24 hour manifest and Importer Security
                                        Filing (ISF) information are due to U.S.
                                        Customs at this stage, as well. The
                                        vessel departs, and then the freight
                                        forwarder sends electronic shipping
                                        details to the customs broker and the
                                        buyer. This step occurs 1 to 2 months
                                        prior to the in-store date.

                                        Step Five: Customs Clearance. Here, the
                                        broker receives electronic entry docs,
                                        and the broker reviews and verifies
                                        documents. The broker then files entry
                                        with U.S. Customs and Other Government
                                        Agencies (OGAs). The buyer sends
                                        allocation instructions to Decon at this
                                        stage, as well. Then, the vessel arrives
                                        and the container is released for
                                        distribution. This all occurs 1 month
                                        prior to the in-store date.

                                        Step 6: Deconsolidation/Shipment to
                                        Final Destination. This occurs 2 weeks
                                        through the in-store date. Here,
                                        delivery is arranged to the
                                        deconsolidation center (or final
                                        destination). Decon then distributes the
                                        product using buyer allocation
                                        instructions. The product is delivered
                                        to the distribution center, warehouse or
                                        store. An Additional Information and
