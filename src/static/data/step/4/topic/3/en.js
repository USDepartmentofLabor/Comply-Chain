                <h1>Assessing External Impacts and Risk Factors</h1>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;External&rdquo; impacts and risks encompass both those linked to a company&rsquo;s operations, products, or services through business relationships, over which you can and should exert influence, and risks over which you have less control, such as those arising from national laws or developments in wider operating environments.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your company is considering sourcing from a new country or geographic area, you are probably already carrying out other forms of risk assessment. Human rights and social compliance risk assessments should be built into those processes. This is addressed further in the next section, Risk and Impact Information Gathering. The assessment should involve identifying people or groups who may be affected by your business activities and projecting any adverse impacts that could occur. Such an assessment should also factor in groups or individuals who may be acutely vulnerable to exploitation, whether through life circumstances (e.g., poverty or lack of education) or through legal and social discrimination. In addition, an assessment should factor in individuals who may be hidden from the public such as survivors of rape and sexual abuse, those living with HIV/AIDS, and undocumented workers, who may face challenges to advocate for their rights. At a minimum, the assessment should involve desk research, field research in the target country/community, and a baseline round of pre-sourcing audits to assess current levels of compliance. More information on how to conduct these types of audits is included in{" "}<Link to="/steps/5">Step 5: Monitor Compliance</Link>.

                <p>
                    If a company already has well-established supply chains with relatively stable business relationships, you should assess the impacts and risks associated with those supply chain actors. This should be done first through a supply chain mapping exercise, together with gathering information on the suppliers most in need of oversight, desk research, field research in the target areas, and a baseline round of audits on those suppliers to assess their current level of compliance. These baseline data allow you to identify suppliers&rsquo; potential areas for improvement. More information on how to conduct these types of audits is included in{" "}<Link to="/steps/5">Step 5: Monitor Compliance</Link>.
