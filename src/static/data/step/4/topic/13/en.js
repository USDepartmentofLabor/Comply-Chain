                 Companies may wish, where feasible, to target philanthropic contributions toward communities in your direct supply chains, particularly those at highest risk for child labor, forced labor, and other labor abuses. While such contributions do not substitute for a robust social compliance system, they can assist in helping your company achieve the goals of a social compliance program.

In communities where children do not have reliable access to education, you can finance a school or educational facility. In communities with schools but where education quality is low, you can finance training for teachers or funding for better teacher salaries. In communities where quality education is available, you can finance a scholarship program. Vocational training is another avenue to provide adolescents with skills to obtain better jobs.

The Iqbal Masih Award is a non-monetary award presented annually by the U.S. Secretary of Labor.</p>
                                                        
                                                        <p>The Iqbal Masih Award was named after a Pakistani child who was sold into slavery as a carpet weaver at age 4, escaped at 10 and became an outspoken public advocate against child exploitation. In 1994 he received the Reebok Human Rights Award. He was tragically killed a year later at the age of 12 in his native Pakistan.</p>
                                                        
                                                        <p>The purpose of the award is to recognize exceptional efforts to reduce the worst forms of child labor&mdash;in view of inspiring and motivating others working toward this end. The award's two major goals are: 1) To honor and give public recognition to a recipient demonstrating extraordinary efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor internationally, and who shares qualities demonstrated by Iqbal Masih including leadership, courage, integrity, and a search to end the labor exploitation of children, and 2) To raise awareness about the worst forms of child labor internationally</p>
                                                        <p>The award was created in response to Senate Committee direction that the Secretary of Labor "establish an annual non-monetary award recognizing the extraordinary efforts by an individual, company, organization or national government toward the reduction of the worst forms of child labor." In 2021, ILAB awarded Norma Flores L&oacute;pez and the International Labor Organization.</p>

She has led the Child Labor Coalition's Domestic Issues Committee for the last decade in support of improved protections for child farmworkers and other vulnerable children. Her work on the committee has helped more than a dozen organizations leverage resources and engage in the fight against child labor.</p>

But League Collegiate Outfitter&rsquo;s El Salvador branch, <a href="https://www.workersrights.org/factory-investigation/league-central-america/">League Central America</a>* (LCA), saw an opportunity to develop a productive enterprise through investing in programs that build the capacity of workers and help tackle poverty and violence in their communities. LCA makes it a priority to hire young workers who would struggle to find work elsewhere, including people with disabilities, former gang members, and those who are vulnerable to joining a gang. Today, rehabilitated gang members make up over 15 percent of the factory&rsquo;s workforce. In addition to decent employment, LCA offers opportunities for youth to participate in a savings and loan program, receive childcare assistance, and further their education, including through high school equivalency classes and English lessons. LCA has found that providing such employment benefits not only empowers vulnerable youth but also reduces worker turnover and improves efficiencies in factory production.</p>

Implemented in more than 300 factory locations in collaboration with Gap Inc. suppliers, the initiative was designed to empower female factory workers with education and life skills training needed to advance in the workplace. Modules cover a range of topics including communication, problem-solving and decision-making, financial literacy, and health. These courses are delivered by certified P.A.C.E. trainers and contextualized to meet the women&rsquo;s needs based on local culture and work environment. The company has since expanded the program to other sites in order to reach more women, including rural community settings, academic and vocational institutions, emergency relief centers, and more. P.A.C.E. is now active in 19 countries and has reached more than 1 million women. In addition, Gap Inc. is partnering with <a href="https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.empoweratwork.org%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CGyenes.James.J%40DOL.gov%7C9f43581ce71043ff615408d7bba07d27%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C1%7C637184170288070350&amp;sdata=yWPIMKHTRqjmjJndGNOBlOosqJEqJnhvsToaIol6Yu4%3D&amp;reserved=0">Empower@Work</a>, an industry-wide effort that seeks to bring this type of training to many more women in the global apparel supply chain.</p>

The current goal of the program is that by 2025, 100 percent of workers employed in Gap Inc.&rsquo;s strategic factories will have their voices heard through representative, gender-equitable workplace committees &ndash; separate from labor unions. The program&rsquo;s approach was designed in partnership with ILO Better Work and reached 197 factories in 2021. Gap Inc. has found that once worker committees are established, workers feel more empowered to raise issues; those issues are then addressed more quickly and, over time, the number of grievances decreases. An evaluation by York University and Better Work found that the Workplace Cooperation Program has improved communication and cooperative work relationships, enhanced the ability of workers and managers to address workplace concerns, and enhanced the case for workplace cooperation.</p>

                                              Reliable, consistent payment of wages relieves a large strain on workers, especially low-income workers who may have little or no savings and are put at risk when paid late or unpredictably. Employers must ensure that workers fully understand the terms of their compensation, including for piece-rate pay, and accept any withholdings from earnings, such as taxes or trade union dues.  Employers can also provide financial literacy training to workers with limited knowledge or access to financial services.
