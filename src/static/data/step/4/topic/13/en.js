                    It may make sense to target philanthropic contributions
                    toward communities in your direct supply chains,
                    particularly those at highest risk for child labor, forced
                    labor and other labor abuses. While such contributions do
                    not substitute for a robust social compliance system, they
                    can assist in helping your company achieve the goals of a
                    social compliance program.

                                             to handling their finances.&nbsp;Providing training
                                             about basic financial competencies can help workers

                                                   Sometimes simple changes in processes can make a big
                                                   difference in workers&rsquo; day-to-day lives. For
                                                   instance, how and when workers are paid is critical for
                                                   low-income individuals. Reliable, consistent payment
                                                   relieves a large strain on workers who may have little
                                                   or no savings to rely upon and are put at risk when paid
                                                   late or unpredictably. Workers who are paid on a piece
                                                   rate basis should fully understand the terms of their
                                                   compensation. Similarly, employers must ensure that
                                                   workers fully understand and accept any withholdings
                                                   from earnings, such as taxes or trade union dues. Job
                                                   training is also an important way for companies to keep
                                                   workers invested in their positions while advancing
                                                   business capacity and productivity.
