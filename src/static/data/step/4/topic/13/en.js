                    It may make sense to target philanthropic contributions
                    toward communities in your direct supply chains,
                    particularly those at highest risk for child labor, forced
                    labor and other labor abuses. While such contributions do
                    not substitute for a robust social compliance system, they
                    can assist in helping your company achieve the goals of a
                    social compliance program.

                                                   Outfitter&rsquo;s El Salvador branch, League Central America
                                                   (LCA), saw an opportunity to develop a productive
                                                   enterprise through investing in programs that build the
                                                   capacity of workers and help tackle poverty and violence
                                                   in their communities. LCA makes it a priority to hire
                                                   young workers who would struggle to find work elsewhere,
                                                   including people with disabilities, former gang members,
                                                   and those who are vulnerable to joining a gang. Today,
                                                   rehabilitated gang members make up over 15 percent of
                                                   the factory&rsquo;s workforce. In addition to decent
                                                   employment, LCA offers opportunities for youth to
                                                   participate in a savings and loan program, receive
                                                   childcare assistance, and further their education,
                                                   including through high school equivalency classes and
                                                   English lessons. LCA has found that providing such
                                                   employment benefits not only empowers vulnerable youth,
                                                   but also reduces worker turnover and improves
                                                   efficiencies in factory production.

                                             about basic financial competencies can help workers

                                                   Sometimes simple changes in processes can make a big
                                                   difference in workers&rsquo; day-to-day lives. For
                                                   instance, how and when workers are paid is critical for
                                                   low-income individuals. Reliable, consistent payment
                                                   relieves a large strain on workers who may have little

                                                   late or unpredictably. Workers who are paid on a piece
                                                   rate basis should fully understand the terms of their
                                                   compensation. Similarly, employers must ensure that
                                                   workers fully understand and accept any withholdings
                                                   from earnings, such as taxes or trade union dues. Job
                                                   training is also an important way for companies to keep
