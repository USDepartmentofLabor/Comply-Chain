                <p>
                    At this point, you probably do not have all the information
                    you need to set up a successful social compliance system.
                    For example, how big a problem is child labor in a
                    particular country or city from which you source? What
                    services should you provide to a victim of labor
                    trafficking, if one is identified in your supply chain? Who
                    should you hire to provide training to your key suppliers on
                    social compliance?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do not try to answer these questions by yourself. By
                    involving your stakeholders in your system, you will gather
                    more ideas and have a broader range of people with whom to
                    vet issues and solutions. Stakeholder involvement allows you
                    to gather a variety of perspectives before you commit to a
                    particular approach. Engaging stakeholders can help you to
                    understand the consequences of certain decisions and actions
                    for specific stakeholders, the varied and changing
                    expectations from stakeholders, and the key issues that
                    surface in your supply chains. It also provides buy-in,
                    because those who participate in the development of a system
                    will be less likely to criticize it later if they see their
                    ideas integrated into your selected approach and programs.
