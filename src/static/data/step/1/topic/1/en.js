                        California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (2010)
                    </a>
                    , enacted in the early 2010&rsquo;s to respond to human
                    rights concerns, require certain companies to publicly
                    disclose information about their supply chains.
                    Since then, there have been more laws passed and
                    regulations promulgated, inside and outside the U.S., that
                    strengthen protections against child labor and forced labor
                    in supply chains.  In addition, a number of countries incorporate
                    various labor provisions into trade agreements.  One recent example
                    is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which has fully
                    enforceable labor standards—including enforcement of laws regarding
                    forced labor and child labor.  USMCA also includes new provisions that
                    require the parties to take measures to prohibit the importation of goods
                    produced by forced labor, including forced child labor, to address violence
                    against workers exercising their labor rights, to address sex-based
                    discrimination in the workplace, and to ensure that migrant workers are protected under labor laws.

                                    , amended March 28, 2017, requires large
                                    corporations with 5,000 or more employees
                                    headquartered in France and foreign
                                    corporations with 10,000 or more employees
                                    doing business in France to create and
                                    implement a vigilance plan. The plan should
                                    identify risks and prevent violations of
                                    human rights such as child labor, forced
                                    labor, and trafficking resulting from the
                                    activities of parent companies,
                                    subsidiaries, and any subcontractors used by
                                    the parent company or subsidiaries.
                                    Vigilance plans must include (1) procedures
                                    to identify risks; (2) methods to regularly
                                    monitor subsidiaries and subcontractors; (3)
                                    adequate approaches to mitigate risks and
                                    prevent serious harm; (4) a method to report
                                    risks; and (5) a method to monitor the
                                    efficacy of preventative measures. Victims
                                    or other affected parties may inform the
                                    courts of a company&rsquo;s failure to have
                                    a plan or implement a plan, and the company
                                    may be ordered to implement a plan and to
                                    compensate victims who suffered because of
                                    its noncompliance as a breach of a duty of
                                    care.

                                    the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
                                    (SEC) to issue regulations requiring
                                    companies that manufacture products
                                    to&nbsp;report on &ldquo;conflict

                                    under Section 1502. Congress enacted Section
                                    1502 because of concerns that the
                                    exploitation and trade of conflict minerals
                                    by armed groups helps finance conflict in
                                    the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
                                    region and contributes to an emergency
                                    humanitarian crisis. The law requires
                                    reporting companies that submit SEC filings
                                    to disclose annually whether products they
                                    manufacture contain tin, tantalum, tungsten
                                    or gold (together considered &ldquo;conflict

                                    the DRC or an adjoining country and, if so,
                                    whether the conflict minerals finance or
                                    benefit armed groups in the DRC
                                    region.&nbsp;

                                    The SEC promulgated a rule requiring companies to determine whether
                                    they use such minerals and whether such minerals are necessary to the
                                    functionality or production of a product they manufactured or contracted
                                    to have manufactured.  If so, the rule requires that companies conduct a
                                    good faith inquiry into the country of origin of the minerals, and make
                                    certain disclosures to the SEC.  Under the rule, companies are also required
                                    to make available on their websites the information they disclosed to the SEC.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    However, the requirement to disclose if products are DRC conflict free was held
                                    by a court to be a violation of the First Amendment.  As a result, the SEC‘s
                                    Division of Corporation Finance suspended enforcement of this disclosure pending
                                    further decision by the SEC on this issue.

                                    <p>
                                    Presently, companies continue to file required forms with the SEC and conduct origin inquiries.

                                    , which was signed into law in October 2010
                                    and went into effect in January 2012,
                                    requires certain companies to report on
                                    their specific actions to eradicate slavery
                                    and human trafficking in their supply
                                    chains. The law is aimed at mid-size and
                                    large retailers and manufacturing companies
                                    with worldwide annual revenues of $100
                                    million or more. Its chief goal is to ensure
                                    companies provide consumers with information
                                    that enables them to understand which ones
                                    manage their supply chains responsibly. It
                                    is estimated that the reporting requirement
                                    will impact about 3,200 companies
                                    headquartered in California or doing
                                    business in the state.

                                    Specifically, the law requires a company to

                                    eradicate slavery and human trafficking from
                                    its direct supply chain for the goods
                                    offered for sale. A company must disclose to
                                    what extent it: (1) engages in verification
                                    of product supply chains to evaluate and
                                    address risks of human trafficking and
                                    slavery; (2) conducts audits of suppliers;
                                    (3) requires direct suppliers to certify
                                    that materials incorporated into the product
                                    comply with the laws regarding slavery and
                                    human trafficking of the countries in which
                                    they are doing business; (4) maintains
                                    accountability standards and procedures for
                                    employees or contractors that fail to meet
                                    company standards regarding slavery and
                                    human trafficking; and (5) provides

                                    and human trafficking.&nbsp;

                                    before going into effect.  This Act will apply to all companies

                                    regardless of the registration or the domicile of the company.  The Act
                                    requires companies to submit a statement that they have applied due diligence
                                    to assess whether a “reasonable suspicion” exists that the services or goods
                                    supplied have come been produced with child labor in their value chains.
                                    If a “reasonable suspicion” is found, the company must adopt and implement
                                    a plan to address the child labor.  Companies must also investigate child labor
                                    in their supply chain using sources that are reasonably known and accessible.
                                    Companies that fail to comply with the law can face fines up to €870,000
                                    or ten percent of worldwide revenue and there is criminal liability for the director.
