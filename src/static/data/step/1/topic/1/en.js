                                    least &pound;36 million annually that
                                    conduct business in the UK to disclose the

                                    and human trafficking. The law does not

                                    provide. A company may comply by noting in
                                    its statement that it has not taken any
                                    steps to combat slavery or human
                                    trafficking. The statement must be published
                                    on the company&rsquo;s website in a
                                    prominent place. There are no penalties for
                                    noncompliance. The Act also creates minimum
                                    sentences for slavery crimes, introduces a

                                    (Dodd-Frank Act), passed in 2010, directed
                                    the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
                                    (SEC) to issue regulations requiring

                                    under Section 1502. Congress enacted Section
                                    1502 because of concerns that the
                                    exploitation and trade of conflict minerals
                                    by armed groups helps finance conflict in

                                    to disclose annually whether products they

                                    , which was signed into law in October 2010
                                    and went into effect in January 2012,
                                    requires certain companies to report on
                                    their specific actions to eradicate slavery
                                    and human trafficking in their supply
                                    chains. The law is aimed at mid-size and
                                    large retailers and manufacturing companies
                                    with worldwide annual revenues of $100
                                    million or more. Its chief goal is to ensure
                                    companies provide consumers with information
                                    that enables them to understand which ones
                                    manage their supply chains responsibly. It
                                    is estimated that the reporting requirement
                                    will impact about 3,200 companies
                                    headquartered in California or doing
                                    business in the state.

                                    Specifically, the law requires a company to
                                    disclose on its website its initiatives to
                                    eradicate slavery and human trafficking from
                                    its direct supply chain for the goods
                                    offered for sale. A company must disclose to
                                    what extent it: (1) engages in verification
                                    of product supply chains to evaluate and
                                    address risks of human trafficking and
                                    slavery; (2) conducts audits of suppliers;
                                    (3) requires direct suppliers to certify
                                    that materials incorporated into the product
                                    comply with the laws regarding slavery and
                                    human trafficking of the countries in which
                                    they are doing business; (4) maintains
                                    accountability standards and procedures for
                                    employees or contractors that fail to meet
                                    company standards regarding slavery and
                                    human trafficking; and (5) provides
                                    employees and management training on slavery
                                    and human trafficking.&nbsp;
