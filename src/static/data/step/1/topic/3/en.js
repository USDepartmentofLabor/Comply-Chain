                    A growing number of consumers are attuned to issues of labor
                    abuse, particularly in industries such as apparel, footwear
                    and electronics. In addition, with the explosion of social
                    media, expos&eacute;s revealing child labor, forced labor or
                    other degrading working conditions in a supply chain can
                    more easily reach consumers and damage a brand&rsquo;s
                    reputation and adversely impact sales or stock prices.
