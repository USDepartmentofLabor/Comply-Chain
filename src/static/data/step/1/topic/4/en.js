                Some companies establish or join groups comprised of multiple
                stakeholders. There are many benefits to involvement in
                multi-stakeholder groups, including learning from other
                companies and other non-corporate experts, and providing a safe
                space to engage collectively with different stakeholders.&nbsp;

                    If a company chooses to form a multi-stakeholder group or
                    join an existing one, it is important to apply the same
                    sound management principles to the group as it does to the
                    social compliance system as a whole. The entity should have
                    clear goals and objectives and metrics or performance
                    indicators to assess progress against them. It should have
                    processes in place for decision-making and governance, and
                    these processes and policies should be documented. And it
                    should have defined members with distinct roles and
                    responsibilities.

                    Over 1.2 million children are estimated to work in
                    agriculture in the Phil&shy;ippines, a sector recognized as
                    one of the most dangerous for children to work. Many of

                    hours under the heat of the sun, use dangerous tools, carry
                    heavy loads, and spray pesticides on the fields. In response

                <p>
                    Palm oil is in approximately half of the packaged products
                    we buy at the supermarket. It is in everything from lipstick
                    to pizza dough, and from non-dairy creamers to automotive
                    cleaners. It is even used to make biodiesel fuels. While the
                    cultivation of palm has been an important motor of economic
                    development around the globe, including in Southeast Asia,
                    which accounts for more than 85 percent of the world&rsquo;s
                    product, the supply is often tainted by child labor. In
                    Indonesia and Malaysia, for example, children are compelled
                    to work alongside their parents, who often must meet harvest
                    quotas to avoid wage deductions and other penalties. On the
                    plantations, they are exposed to toxic chemicals and risk
                    injury from carrying heavy loads. Children toiling in the
                    palm oil industry &ndash; whether in Southeast Asia, Africa,
                    or Latin America &ndash; often work long hours and miss
                    school.

                    Verit&eacute;* and the International Labor Rights Forum*, as
                    well as key environmental watchdogs. Its mission is to build
                    on the advances that the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
                    (RSPO) has made to combat child labor. Companies signing the
                    POIG Charter must certify that all of their palm production
                    conforms to the RSPO standard, as well as that of
                    subsidiaries and third-party suppliers, within 2 years. In
                    addition, POIG members must demonstrate, through published
                    and independent, third-party verification, additional social
                    and environmental standards across all operations. This
                    means maintaining a clear policy and compliance system that
                    prohibits child labor, including its worst forms, throughout
                    a member&rsquo;s supply chain. By certifying that operations
                    conform to rigorous standards, POIG creates market
                    recognition for the leading companies in the RSPO, and
                    encourages a race to the top. This could not be timelier,
                    given that the global production of palm has doubled in the
                    past decade and is expected to continue to increase rapidly.
