                    standards and human rights in their supply chains have
                    intensified in recent years. For decades, voluntary

                    , have played important roles in this shift in public
                    expectations. Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business
                    and Human Rights, states have the duty to protect against
                    human rights abuse within their territory and/or
                    jurisdiction by third parties, including business
                    enterprises. States also have the duty to take appropriate
                    steps to ensure that when such abuses occur, those affected
                    have access to effective remedy. For their part, business
                    enterprises have the responsibility to respect human rights,
                    including by avoiding causing or contributing to adverse
                    human rights impacts through their own activities, and by
                    seeking to prevent or mitigate such impacts that are
                    directly linked to their operations, products, or services
                    by their business relationships. The UN Guiding Principles
                    apply to all states and to all business enterprises, both
                    transnational and others, regardless of their size, sector,
                    location, ownership and structure.
