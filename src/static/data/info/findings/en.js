                <h1>Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor Report</h1>
                <p>
                    USDOL&rsquo;s annual <em>Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor</em> focuses on the efforts of more than 130 U.S. trade beneficiary countries and 
                    territories to eliminate the worst forms of child labor through legislation, enforcement mechanisms, policies, and social programs. The 
                    report presents information on the prevalence and sectoral distribution of child labor in each country and assesses the extent to which 
                    governments have taken action to address the problem during each reporting year. It also provides country-specific suggestions for 
                    government action, which businesses and civil society actors can use to identify points of leverage in their own engagements with their 
                    respective governments.

                    The report serves as a great resource for companies with global supply chains, foreign governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 
                    academics, and policymakers working on labor and human rights issues. It helps inform Congress and executive branch agencies that formulate 
                    labor and trade policy and is an important resource for USDOL in assessing future technical assistance and research priorities as it seeks 
                    to address child labor around the world.

                    The Department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) has published the report each year since 2002, as mandated by the Trade and 
                    Development Act of 2000 (TDA). The TDA requires that countries fulfill commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor to be eligible 
                    for certain U.S. trade preference programs. It also requires the U.S. Secretary of Labor to issue annual findings on beneficiary country 
                    initiatives to implement these commitments.
