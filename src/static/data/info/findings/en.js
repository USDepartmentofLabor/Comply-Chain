                <p>
                    The Department of Labor's annual Findings on the Worst Forms
                    of Child Labor focuses on the efforts of certain U.S. trade
                    beneficiary countries and territories to eliminate the worst
                    forms of child labor through legislation, enforcement
                    mechanisms, policies and social programs. Read More

                        Findings on the prevalence and sectoral distribution of

                        Significant, Moderate, Minimal, or No Advancement has

                        The Report serves as a resource to foreign governments,
                        NGOs, academics and policymakers working on labor and
                        human rights issues. It helps inform Congress and
                        Executive Branch agencies that formulate labor and trade
                        policy and is an important resource for the Department
                        in assessing future technical assistance and research
                        priorities as it seeks to combat child labor around the
                        world.

                    The Department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs
                    (ILAB) has published the Findings each year since 2002, as
                    mandated by the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (TDA). The
                    TDA requires that countries fulfill commitments to eliminate
                    the worst forms of child labor to be eligible for certain
                    U.S. trade preference programs. It also requires the U.S.
                    Secretary of Labor to issue annual findings on beneficiary
                    country initiatives to implement these commitments.
