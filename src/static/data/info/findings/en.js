                <p>
                    The Department of Labor's annual Findings on the Worst Forms
                    of Child Labor focuses on the efforts of more than 130 U.S. trade
                    beneficiary countries and territories to eliminate the worst
                    forms of child labor through legislation, enforcement
                    mechanisms, policies and social programs.
                </p>
                The Report presents:

                    <li>
                        Findings on the prevalence and sectoral distribution of
                        the worst forms of child labor in each country.

                        Country-specific suggestions for government action
                        (since 2009).

                        Individual country assessments that identify where
                        Significant, Moderate, Minimal, or No Advancement has
                        been made (since 2011).

                    The Report serves as a great resource to companies with global supply chains,
                    foreign governments,
                    NGOs, academics and policymakers working on labor and human
                    rights issues. It helps inform Congress and Executive Branch
                    agencies that formulate labor and trade policy and is an
                    important resource for the Department in assessing future
                    technical assistance and research priorities as it seeks to
                    combat child labor around the world.

                    The Department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs
                    (ILAB) has published the Findings each year since 2002, as
                    mandated by the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (TDA). The
                    TDA requires that countries fulfill commitments to eliminate
                    the worst forms of child labor to be eligible for certain
                    U.S. trade preference programs. It also requires the U.S.
                    Secretary of Labor to issue annual findings on beneficiary
                    country initiatives to implement these commitments.
