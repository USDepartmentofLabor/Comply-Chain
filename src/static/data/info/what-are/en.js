                                of work. Children harvest cotton in
                                Turkmenistan, work as domestic servants in Haiti
                                and mine diamonds in the Central African

                                It is important to recognize that not all work
                                performed by children is exploitative child
                                labor. Children of legal working age who perform
                                work that does not hinder their mental, physical
                                or emotional development, &ldquo;working

                                their nations' economic development. Such work
                                can be performing household chores in their own
                                homes, assisting parents in a family business

                            <h3>Drivers of Child Labor</h3>
                            <p>
                                Children enter the labor force due to both
                                supply factors and industry demand for cheap,
                                unskilled labor, among other factors. Poverty is
                                the most salient source of pressure leading to
                                the supply of child labor. Production processes
                                that require an abundance of unskilled labor or
                                that require certain physical
                                attributes&mdash;small stature, agility,
                                etc.&mdash;can also create demand for child
                                labor. In addition, price pressures encourage
                                suppliers, especially at points upstream in the
                                supply chain, to find the cheapest labor.
                                Children may be the only workers willing to work
                                for these wages, or adults may find that these
                                wage levels do not allow them to meet basic
                                needs and they must put their children to work
                                to supplement family income. These fundamental
                                supply and demand factors are often reinforced
                                by factors such as a lack of adequate access to

                                found in ILO Convention 29. According to this
                                Convention, forced or compulsory labor is "all
                                work or service which is exacted from any person
                                under the menace of any penalty and for which

                                voluntarily." There are four key elements to
                                this definition, and indicators related to each
                                element, as set forth below. The combination of
                                indicators for each situation must be analyzed
                                in order to determine whether the situation is
                                one of forced labor or not.

                                    penalty if they refuse to work. "Menace"
                                    means the penalty need not be exacted, but
                                    rather, that threats of penalty may be
                                    sufficient, if the employee believes the
                                    employer will exact the penalty. A wide
                                    variety of penalties, such as confinement to
                                    the workplace, violence against workers or

                                    employment and their freedom to leave the
                                    employment at any time, with reasonable
                                    notice in accordance with national law or
                                    collective agreements. In essence, persons
                                    are in a forced labor situation if they
                                    enter work or service against their free
                                    choice, and cannot leave it without penalty
                                    or the threat of penalty. Involuntariness
                                    does not have to result from physical
                                    punishment or constraint; it can also stem
                                    from other forms of retaliation, such as the
                                    loss of rights or privileges or non-payment
                                    of wages owed. Note that a worker can be
                                    considered to be in forced labor even if his
                                    or her consent was given, if that consent
                                    was obtained through the use of force,
                                    abduction, fraud, deception or the abuse of
                                    power or a position of vulnerability, or if
                                    the consent has been revoked.

                            <p>
                                Forced labor can happen in any industry and
                                country, and can be especially prevalent in
                                industries that require low-skilled labor, such
                                as agriculture and mining, or occupations hidden
                                from public view, like domestic service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Until the 20th century, most of the world's
                                forced labor was rooted in traditional social
                                stratification systems and patterns of
                                discrimination, agrarian production structures,
                                conquest, colonialism and the slave trade.
                                Certain castes, religious minorities, and
                                indigenous peoples have long been vulnerable to
                                forced labor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Forced labor is not just a historical problem.
                                Today, as in the past, some governments force
                                their citizens to carry out infrastructure
                                projects, produce goods, raise crops and perform
                                other forms of work. Indeed, the ILO estimates
                                that 16 percent of forced labor worldwide is
                                state-imposed forced labor. This includes prison
                                labor where victims are imprisoned without
                                conviction by a court of law, and made to
                                perform work or service.

                                Labor migration has also given rise to forced
                                labor.&nbsp;

                                intermediaries, organized crime syndicates, and
                                employers offering false contract terms and
                                other fraudulent schemes. Many migrants pay fees
                                to such recruiters or intermediaries and become
                                trapped in debt bondage: cyclical debt, often
                                including unreasonable interest or other terms
                                that their wages are insufficient to repay.
                                Cycles of debt bondage can also occur when
                                employers deduct from workers' wages for
                                housing, food and other costs, leaving them with
                                little or no take-home pay.{" "}

                                Modern dynamics of global production and demand
                                for cheaper, disposable goods have also
                                increased worker vulnerability to forced labor.
                                For instance, buyer pressure on suppliers to
                                complete orders in an unreasonable amount of
                                time can lead suppliers to force workers to work
                                long hours, often without extra compensation. It
                                can also lead suppliers to outsource production
                                to subcontractors beyond their network of
                                allowable subcontractors. In many countries,
                                these are small, informal businesses that are
                                not registered with the government and are not
                                visible to the buyer, leaving workers outside
                                the purview of legal protections and social
                                compliance systems.

                                While poverty can push people into exploitative
                                work, it is important to distinguish between
                                very poor working conditions and forced labor. A
                                lack of economic alternatives, such as other
                                jobs, does not by itself qualify a situation as
                                one of forced labor. Nor do unsafe buildings,
                                poor health and safety conditions, substandard
                                employer-provided housing, or other labor rights
                                violations constitute, on their own, forced
                                labor. Forced labor is distinguished by the
                                worker feeling a threat of penalty, exacted by
                                his or her employer or an agent of the employer,
                                such as a supervisor or recruiter, and
                                performing work involuntarily.
