                <h1>Why Develop a Social Compliance System?</h1>
                <p>
                    Eradicating child and forced labor and educating children
                    are fundamental government responsibilities.
                    Companies&rsquo; social compliance programs can help fill
                    critical gaps where governments have not yet developed full
                    capacity &ndash; and, as outlined below, they fulfill other
                    important responsibilities and objectives. At the same time,
                    they do not substitute for strong government action to
                    protect children and workers, and should not be regarded as
                    adequate substitutes for the responsibilities of
                    governments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies have a variety of motivations for implementing
                    social compliance systems. These may include the following.

                                    provide. A company may comply by noting in
                                    its statement that it has not taken any
                                    steps to combat slavery or human
                                    trafficking. The statement must be published

                                    noncompliance. The Act also creates minimum
                                    sentences for slavery crimes, introduces a

                                    (Dodd-Frank Act), passed in 2010, directed
                                    the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
                                    (SEC) to issue regulations requiring

                                    1502 because of concerns that the
                                    exploitation and trade of conflict minerals
                                    by armed groups helps finance conflict in

                                    to disclose annually whether products they

                                    , which was signed into law in October 2010
                                    and went into effect in January 2012,
                                    requires certain companies to report on
                                    their specific actions to eradicate slavery
                                    and human trafficking in their supply
                                    chains. The law is aimed at mid-size and
                                    large retailers and manufacturing companies
                                    with worldwide annual revenues of $100
                                    million or more. Its chief goal is to ensure
                                    companies provide consumers with information
                                    that enables them to understand which ones
                                    manage their supply chains responsibly. It
                                    is estimated that the reporting requirement
                                    will impact about 3,200 companies
                                    headquartered in California or doing
                                    business in the state.

                                    Specifically, the law requires a company to

                                    eradicate slavery and human trafficking from
                                    its direct supply chain for the goods
                                    offered for sale. A company must disclose to
                                    what extent it: (1) engages in verification
                                    of product supply chains to evaluate and
                                    address risks of human trafficking and
                                    slavery; (2) conducts audits of suppliers;
                                    (3) requires direct suppliers to certify
                                    that materials incorporated into the product
                                    comply with the laws regarding slavery and
                                    human trafficking of the countries in which
                                    they are doing business; (4) maintains
                                    accountability standards and procedures for
                                    employees or contractors that fail to meet
                                    company standards regarding slavery and
                                    human trafficking; and (5) provides

                                    and human trafficking.&nbsp;

                    , have played important roles in this shift in public
                    expectations. Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business
                    and Human Rights, states have the duty to protect against
                    human rights abuse within their territory and/or
                    jurisdiction by third parties, including business
                    enterprises. States also have the duty to take appropriate
                    steps to ensure that when such abuses occur, those affected
                    have access to effective remedy. For their part, business
                    enterprises have the responsibility to respect human rights,
                    including by avoiding causing or contributing to adverse
                    human rights impacts through their own activities, and by
                    seeking to prevent or mitigate such impacts that are
                    directly linked to their operations, products, or services
                    by their business relationships. The UN Guiding Principles
                    apply to all states and to all business enterprises, both
                    transnational and others, regardless of their size, sector,
                    location, ownership and structure.

                <p>
                    A growing number of consumers are attuned to issues of labor
                    abuse, particularly in industries such as apparel, footwear
                    and electronics. In addition, with the explosion of social
                    media, expos&eacute;s revealing child labor, forced labor or
                    other degrading working conditions in a supply chain can
                    more easily reach consumers and damage a brand&rsquo;s
                    reputation and adversely impact sales or stock prices.

                    In some industries, having a social compliance system in
                    place has become the norm. Companies can set themselves
                    apart by having an especially strong system in place, or by
                    excelling in certain areas of social or environmental
                    compliance and marketing these strengths to their buyers,

                    addition, data on companies&rsquo; social and environmental
                    performance are increasingly available to the public through

                    civil society groups conduct investigations, publicize
                    problems and raise awareness about corporate conduct. Some
                    seek to educate consumers about labor issues or launch
                    boycotts and other campaigns to stop egregious abuses. Some
                    approach companies directly to discuss and address labor
                    concerns and do not disclose their findings publicly unless
                    the companies choose not to take meaningful action.

                    , part of the World Bank Group, must adhere to specific

                    supply chains, including standards on child and forced
                    labor. These standards require due diligence to identify
                    problems and focused efforts to remedy them, which can be
                    accomplished through a strong social compliance system.
                </p>
                <h2>Improved supply chain management</h2>
                <p>
                    Good social compliance systems are based on strong overall
                    management systems. They require planning, documentation,
                    internal controls, training and communication with company
                    employees, sound analysis of data, and other clearly-defined
                    policies and procedures. Implementing a social compliance
                    system requires a company to gain control over complex
                    global supply chains, which can bring additional
                    efficiencies and benefits to its operations.
                </p>
                <h2>Employee recruitment and retention</h2>
                <p>
                    A growing body of research shows that employees,
                    particularly younger ones, increasingly prefer to work for
                    companies that are socially and environmentally responsible,
                    and factor this into future employment decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>Doing good</h2>
                <p>
                    For some companies, having a social compliance system is
                    intrinsically &ldquo;the right thing to do.&rdquo; Such
                    companies are more likely to devote significant support and
                    resources to their social compliance systems.
