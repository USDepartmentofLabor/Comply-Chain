            <h1>Why Develop a Social Compliance System?</h1>
            <p>
                Eradicating child and forced labor and educating children are
                fundamental government responsibilities. Companies&rsquo; social
                compliance programs can help fill critical gaps where
                governments have not yet developed full capacity &ndash; and, as
                outlined below, they fulfill other important responsibilities
                and objectives. At the same time, they do not substitute for
                strong government action to protect children and workers, and
                should not be regarded as adequate substitutes for the
                responsibilities of governments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Companies have a variety of motivations for implementing social
                compliance systems. These may include the following.
            </p>
            <h2>Laws and regulations</h2>
            <p>
                Social compliance systems, traditionally viewed as a purely
                voluntary undertaking, are becoming increasingly important tools
                to meet legal requirements. Legislation in the U.S., notably the
                Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010)
                and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (2010),
                enacted in the early 2010&rsquo;s to respond to human rights
                concerns, require certain companies to publicly disclose
                information about their supply chains.&nbsp;Since then, there
                have been more laws passed and regulations promulgated, inside
                and outside the U.S., that strengthen protections against child
                labor and forced labor in supply chains.&nbsp;

                                to combat slavery or human trafficking. The

                                , amended March 28, 2017, requires large
                                corporations with 5,000 or more employees
                                headquartered in France and foreign corporations
                                with 10,000 or more employees doing business in
                                France to create and implement a vigilance plan.
                                The plan should identify risks and prevent
                                violations of human rights such as child labor,
                                forced labor, and trafficking resulting from the

                                company or subsidiaries. Vigilance plans must
                                include (1) procedures to identify risks; (2)
                                methods to regularly monitor subsidiaries and
                                subcontractors; (3) adequate approaches to
                                mitigate risks and prevent serious harm; (4) a
                                method to report risks; and (5) a method to
                                monitor the efficacy of preventative measures.

                                courts of a company&rsquo;s failure to have a

                                ordered to implement a plan and to compensate
                                victims who suffered because of its
                                noncompliance as a breach of a duty of care.

                                which ones manage their supply chains
                                responsibly. It is estimated that the reporting
                                requirement will impact about 3,200 companies
                                headquartered in California or doing business in
                                the state.

                                Specifically, the law requires a company to
                                disclose on its website its initiatives to
                                eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its
                                direct supply chain for the goods offered for
                                sale. A company must disclose to what extent it:
                                (1) engages in verification of product supply
                                chains to evaluate and address risks of human
                                trafficking and slavery; (2) conducts audits of
                                suppliers; (3) requires direct suppliers to
                                certify that materials incorporated into the
                                product comply with the laws regarding slavery
                                and human trafficking of the countries in which
                                they are doing business; (4) maintains
                                accountability standards and procedures for
                                employees or contractors that fail to meet
                                company standards regarding slavery and human
                                trafficking; and (5) provides employees and
                                management training on slavery and human
                                trafficking.&nbsp;

            <p>
                Public expectations of companies&rsquo; control over labor
                standards and human rights in their supply chains have
                intensified in recent years. For decades, voluntary standards
                such as the{" "}

                have articulated basic norms for companies with respect to labor

                </a>
                , have played important roles in this shift in public
                expectations. Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and
                Human Rights, states have the duty to protect against human
                rights abuse within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third
                parties, including business enterprises. States also have the
                duty to take appropriate steps to ensure that when such abuses
                occur, those affected have access to effective remedy. For their
                part, business enterprises have the responsibility to respect
                human rights, including by avoiding causing or contributing to
                adverse human rights impacts through their own activities, and
                by seeking to prevent or mitigate such impacts that are directly
                linked to their operations, products, or services by their
                business relationships. The UN Guiding Principles apply to all
                states and to all business enterprises, both transnational and
                others, regardless of their size, sector, location, ownership
                and structure.

            <h2>Company reputation</h2>
            <p>
                A growing number of consumers are attuned to issues of labor
                abuse, particularly in industries such as apparel, footwear and
                electronics. In addition, with the explosion of social media,
                expos&eacute;s revealing child labor, forced labor or other
                degrading working conditions in a supply chain can more easily
                reach consumers and damage a brand&rsquo;s reputation and
                adversely impact sales or stock prices.
            </p>
            <h2>Marketing and competitiveness</h2>
            <p>
                In some industries, having a social compliance system in place
                has become the norm. Companies can set themselves apart by
                having an especially strong system in place, or by excelling in
                certain areas of social or environmental compliance and
                marketing these strengths to their buyers, appropriate
                demographic groups or other stakeholders. In addition, data on
                companies&rsquo; social and environmental performance are
                increasingly available to the public through data sources like
                the{" "}

                Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade unions, sustainable
                and responsible investor (SRI) bodies and other civil society
                groups conduct investigations, publicize problems and raise
                awareness about corporate conduct. Some seek to educate
                consumers about labor issues or launch boycotts and other
                campaigns to stop egregious abuses. Some approach companies
                directly to discuss and address labor concerns and do not
                disclose their findings publicly unless the companies choose not
                to take meaningful action.

                and environmental standards in their operations and supply
                chains, including standards on child and forced labor. These
                standards require due diligence to identify problems and focused
                efforts to remedy them, which can be accomplished through a
                strong social compliance system.
            </p>
            <h2>Improved supply chain management</h2>
            <p>
                Good social compliance systems are based on strong overall
                management systems. They require planning, documentation,
                internal controls, training and communication with company
                employees, sound analysis of data, and other clearly-defined
                policies and procedures. Implementing a social compliance system
                requires a company to gain control over complex global supply
                chains, which can bring additional efficiencies and benefits to
                its operations.
            </p>
            <h2>Employee recruitment and retention</h2>
            <p>
                A growing body of research shows that employees, particularly
                younger ones, increasingly prefer to work for companies that are

                For some companies, having a social compliance system is
                intrinsically &ldquo;the right thing to do.&rdquo; Such
                companies are more likely to devote significant support and
                resources to their social compliance systems.
