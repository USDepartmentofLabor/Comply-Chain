                            Before using this App, it is important to
                            familiarize yourself with the basics of a social
                            compliance system. The links below can assist.

                                While systems may vary from industry to
                                industry, a good social compliance system in any
                                industry includes eight components, functioning
                                in an integrated way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although the steps below are numbered for ease
                                of understanding, social compliance is an
                                iterative and ongoing process. Companies may
                                choose to proceed through these steps in a
                                different order, and typically should not expect
                                to complete one step before undertaking another.
                                At the same time, a system without all
                                components―for example, an auditing system that
                                operates in isolation from communication and
                                training, remediation and other measures―is very
                                likely not to be sufficient to address
                                challenging labor issues that can arise in
                                global supply chains.

                                In some industries, groups of companies have
                                already come together to develop joint social
                                compliance systems&mdash;or in some cases,
                                system components&mdash;that individual
                                companies can adopt. Joining such networks
                                usually entails a commitment of time and
                                resources to collaborate with other companies,
                                but ultimately may save effort and resources by
                                capitalizing on other companies&rsquo; insights
                                and experiences. It is important to learn about
                                the initiatives that exist in your industry
                                before deciding to either join an existing
                                program or develop your own.

                                Today, around the world there are roughly 80,000
                                transnational enterprises and ten times as many
                                subsidiaries. Most U.S. companies doing business
                                globally contract with vendors, agents and/or
                                producers abroad rather than owning production
                                facilities overseas. Moreover, few companies
                                market or sell a single product line, and many
                                deal in hundreds if not thousands of products.
                                Companies&rsquo; supply chains are long and
                                complex, with a large number of links from their
                                immediate suppliers back to the farms or mines
                                where raw materials are sourced.

                                For most companies, a social compliance system
                                that enables oversight and control over every
                                actor in every supply chain may be challenging.
                                At the same time, it is fundamentally important
                                that your company not only avoids causing or
                                contributing to child and forced labor though
                                its own activities, but also seek to prevent or
                                mitigate adverse labor rights impacts linked to
                                its business operations through business

                                Ideally, a company&rsquo;s compliance system
                                should be designed to prioritize those areas of
                                the supply chain where the risk of egregious
                                labor abuses is most significant, whether due to
                                the operating context, the products or services

                                Like any successful business unit, the social
                                compliance management team should have
                                management systems that are integrated into the
                                overall systems of the company, rather than
                                existing in a silo separate from other business
                                operations. Many management system elements―such
                                as risk assessment, communication plans,
                                information systems, grievance and complaint
                                mechanisms, and independent verification―are the
                                subject of this App and are covered more
                                comprehensively in different sections.

                                Managing any system or program should start with
                                setting goals, objectives and targets for
                                performance. Many social compliance programs
                                establish metrics, or Key Performance Indicators
                                (KPIs), against which to measure progress. KPIs
                                can be developed internally, or as part of a
                                benchmarking exercise to compare against other
                                companies&rsquo; programs. Once set, the team
                                should periodically check progress against those
                                targets or indicators, and address areas where
                                they have not been met. The team should also
                                periodically review its processes and policies
                                and update them as needed. Companies with strong
                                social compliance systems are always in
                                &ldquo;continuous improvement&rdquo; mode.&nbsp;

                                At a practical level, the management team should

                                functions of the social compliance system. This
                                documentation should include written policies
                                and procedures for all components of the system,
                                as well as communication protocols. It should

                                units of the company&mdash;for example, a

                        <p>
                            In multinational companies, the social compliance
                            team is typically comprised of both a management
                            team, based at headquarters, and a field team, based
                            in countries from which products are sourced, while
                            SME&rsquo;s typically have smaller social compliance
                            teams.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Corporate structures vary widely, but a social
                            compliance team is often part of a larger corporate
                            social responsibility (CSR) or sustainability
                            department within the company. The hallmark of the
                            most successful social compliance/CSR teams is that
                            they have a direct line of communication with
                            high-level decision makers, including the CEO and
                            Board of Directors. In addition, the social
                            compliance/CSR function must be well-integrated with
                            other components of the company, particularly in
                            areas such as supply chain management, product
                            development and sourcing. For example, Nike
                            Corporation&rsquo;s social compliance function sits
                            within its &ldquo;

                            </a>
                            ,&rdquo; which is responsible for not only
                            environmental and social compliance but also product
                            development.

                        <p>
                            The social compliance management team oversees the
                            entire social compliance system. It plans
                            activities, monitors implementation and receives and
                            analyzes reports from the field. Ideally, the team
                            is also empowered to make decisions on individual
                            situations and on the system as a whole. Aside from
                            core management skills such as budgeting and data
                            analysis, the management team should include members
                            who have the flexibility to deal with unexpected
                            situations, who can motivate and support the field
                            team and who can advocate on behalf of the system to
                            senior management. Management team members should
                            also have some field exposure. They should shadow
                            audits, speak with workers and the labor unions that
                            represent them, both at the workplace and outside
                            it, and experience for themselves the reality of
                            workplaces from which products are sourced.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The social compliance management team should also be
                            positioned for long-term continuity. In companies
                            where social compliance is segregated from other
                            business functions, the departure of one or two key
                            members of the team can damage the entire social
                            compliance program. It is important, therefore, that
                            the team build capacity across a spectrum of staff
                            members, so operations can survive changes in
