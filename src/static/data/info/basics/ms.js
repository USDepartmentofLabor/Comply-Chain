                                    industry, a good social compliance system in
                                    any industry includes eight components,
                                    functioning in an integrated way.

                                    ease of understanding, social compliance is
                                    an iterative and ongoing process. Companies
                                    may choose to proceed through these steps in
                                    a different order, and typically should not
                                    expect to complete one step before
                                    undertaking another. At the same time, a

                                    likely not to be sufficient to address

                                    In some industries, groups of companies have
                                    already come together to develop joint

                                    individual companies can adopt. Joining such
                                    networks usually entails a commitment of
                                    time and resources to collaborate with other
                                    companies, but ultimately may save effort
                                    and resources by capitalizing on other
                                    companies&rsquo; insights and experiences.
                                    It is important to learn about the

                                    Today, around the world there are roughly

                                    times as many subsidiaries. Most U.S.
                                    companies doing business globally contract
                                    with vendors, agents and/or producers abroad
                                    rather than owning production facilities
                                    overseas. Moreover, few companies market or
                                    sell a single product line, and many deal in
                                    hundreds if not thousands of products.

                                    fundamentally important that your company

                                    to measure progress. KPIs can be developed
                                    internally, or as part of a benchmarking
                                    exercise to compare against other

                                    team should periodically check progress
                                    against those targets or indicators, and
                                    address areas where they have not been met.
                                    The team should also periodically review its
                                    processes and policies and update them as

                            <p>
                                In multinational companies, the social
                                compliance team is typically comprised of both a
                                management team, based at headquarters, and a
                                field team, based in countries from which
                                products are sourced, while SME&rsquo;s
                                typically have smaller social compliance teams.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Corporate structures vary widely, but a social
                                compliance team is often part of a larger
                                corporate social responsibility (CSR) or
                                sustainability department within the company.
                                The hallmark of the most successful social
                                compliance/CSR teams is that they have a direct
                                line of communication with high-level decision
                                makers, including the CEO and Board of
                                Directors. In addition, the social
                                compliance/CSR function must be well-integrated
                                with other components of the company,
                                particularly in areas such as supply chain
                                management, product development and sourcing.

                                The social compliance management team oversees
                                the entire social compliance system. It plans
                                activities, monitors implementation and receives
                                and analyzes reports from the field. Ideally,
                                the team is also empowered to make decisions on
                                individual situations and on the system as a
                                whole. Aside from core management skills such as
                                budgeting and data analysis, the management team
                                should include members who have the flexibility
                                to deal with unexpected situations, who can
                                motivate and support the field team and who can
                                advocate on behalf of the system to senior
                                management. Management team members should also
                                have some field exposure. They should shadow
                                audits, speak with workers and the labor unions
                                that represent them, both at the workplace and
                                outside it, and experience for themselves the
                                reality of workplaces from which products are

                                The social compliance management team should
                                also be positioned for long-term continuity. In
                                companies where social compliance is segregated
                                from other business functions, the departure of
                                one or two key members of the team can damage
                                the entire social compliance program. It is
                                important, therefore, that the team build
                                capacity across a spectrum of staff members, so
                                operations can survive changes in personnel.

                                Finally, the management team must have resources
                                adequate to do its job. Above all, the
                                allocation of resources from senior management,
                                as well as performance incentive structures that
                                reward employees for social compliance
                                innovation, initiative and impact, are signals
                                that social compliance matters to the company.
