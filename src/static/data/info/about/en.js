            <p>
                In the era of globalization, the production of goods in foreign
                countries has increased at a rapid pace. Unfortunately in too
                many countries, illegal labor practices persist, either going
                unchecked or willfully ignored. Lack of accountability and
                oversight of labor rights has made it more likely that goods
                imported into the U.S. may be tainted by child labor and forced
                labor. The importation of forced labor-made goods is a violation
                of U.S. trade policy that gives an unfair competitive advantage
                to countries and businesses that do not play by the rules. In
                turn, such abuses force U.S. workers and responsible businesses
                to compete on an uneven playing field.
            </p>

                The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there
                are 152 million children 5-17 years old in child labor
                worldwide, 73 million of them in hazardous forms of work. It
                also estimates that 25 million adults and children are in forced
                labor.

                           , Congress added a new mandate to ILAB related to this List.
                           Specifically, in Section 133 of the new law, Congress included language to require that “to the extent
                           practicable, goods that are produced with inputs that are produced with forced labor or child labor” be
                           added to the List of Goods.  This new language challenges ILAB and others around the world to not just
                           examine final goods and products, but the inputs to those goods and products.  ILAB’s expanded mandate
                           reinforces the expanding parameters of due diligence and confronting child labor and forced labor across
                           often complex and multi tier global supply chains.

                            this alliance is the business community. Eradicating
                            child and forced labor by 2025 cannot be achieved
                            without sustained commitment from the businesses
                            that mine, produce, manufacture, distribute, and
                            sell goods around the world. Businesses create jobs
                            and find workers to perform the jobs; they bear a
                            responsibility to ensure that these working
                            relationships respect national laws and fundamental
                            labor rights. Some businesses and industry groups
                            have long taken this responsibility seriously,
                            through robust voluntary standards, due diligence,
                            remediation, transparency, and engagement with
                            stakeholders. Now, the combination of increased
                            pressure from stakeholders and incentives to develop
                            stronger responses is driving more businesses to
                            acknowledge and address labor abuses in their supply
                            chains. ILAB is committed to working alongside the
                            business community in this effort.</p>

                        <p>
                            Since 1993, ILAB has developed a unique approach to
                            using research to combat these abuses. ILAB employs
                            a systematic and rigorous process to triangulate
                            information, supporting the collection of in-country
                            data, traveling to conduct first hand research in
                            hard-to-reach places, and corroborating reports of
                            labor abuses with credible local sources. This
                            approach helps ensure the credibility and validity
                            of ILAB&rsquo;s publications on child labor and
                            forced labor. ILAB uses these reports to provide
                            critical and actionable information to federal
                            government agencies to safeguard federal
                            procurement, help U.S. companies reduce labor abuses
                            in their supply chains, and help foreign governments
                            build their capacity to end modern slavery in their
                            countries. This app is part of that effort.

                            this app, beginning with the National Academy of
                            Sciences and the Center for Reflection, Education
                            and Action (CREA), both of which carried out initial
                            research under contract with ILAB. ILAB also
                            collected good practices from the many organizations
                            whose materials are linked throughout the app.

                            provided feedback on the initial draft, as did a

                            academia, unions, the socially responsible
