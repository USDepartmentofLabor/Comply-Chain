            <h1>About the Comply Chain App</h1>
            <p>
                In the era of globalization, the production of goods in foreign
                countries has increased at a rapid pace. Unfortunately in too
                many countries, illegal labor practices persist, either going
                unchecked or willfully ignored. Lack of accountability and
                oversight of labor rights has made it more likely that goods
                imported into the U.S. may be tainted by child labor and forced
                labor. The importation of forced labor-made goods is a violation
                of U.S. trade policy that gives an unfair competitive advantage
                to countries and businesses that do not play by the rules. In
                turn, such abuses force U.S. workers and responsible businesses
                to compete on an uneven playing field.
            </p>

                The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there
                are 152 million children 5-17 years old in child labor
                worldwide, 73 million of them in hazardous forms of work. It
                also estimates that 25 million adults and children are in forced
                labor.

                By downloading this App, you have shown that you are concerned
                about these grim realities. You are interested in reducing the
                chance that your products&mdash;and the raw materials they come
                from&mdash;are manufactured, mined or harvested by children who
                should be in school, or by workers locked in sweatshops or
                forced into work through false promises or threats.

                This App was created by the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL)
                Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB). ILAB promotes a
                fair global playing field for workers in the United States and
                around the world by enforcing trade commitments; strengthening
                labor standards; and combating international child labor, forced
                labor, and human trafficking.&nbsp;

                            an interest in achieving Target 8.7. A key actor in
                            this alliance is the business community. Eradicating
                            child and forced labor by 2025 cannot be achieved
                            without sustained commitment from the businesses
                            that mine, produce, manufacture, distribute, and
                            sell goods around the world. Businesses create jobs
                            and find workers to perform the jobs; they bear a
                            responsibility to ensure that these working
                            relationships respect national laws and fundamental
                            labor rights. Some businesses and industry groups
                            have long taken this responsibility seriously,
                            through robust voluntary standards, due diligence,
                            remediation, transparency, and engagement with
                            stakeholders. Now, the combination of increased
                            pressure from stakeholders and incentives to develop
                            stronger responses is driving more businesses to
                            acknowledge and address labor abuses in their supply
                            chains. ILAB is committed to working alongside the
                            business community in this effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since 1993, ILAB has developed a unique approach to
                            using research to combat these abuses. ILAB employs
                            a systematic and rigorous process to triangulate
                            information, supporting the collection of in-country
                            data, traveling to conduct first hand research in
                            hard-to-reach places, and corroborating reports of
                            labor abuses with credible local sources. This
                            approach helps ensure the credibility and validity
                            of ILAB&rsquo;s publications on child labor and
                            forced labor. ILAB uses these reports to provide
                            critical and actionable information to federal
                            government agencies to safeguard federal
                            procurement, help U.S. companies reduce labor abuses
                            in their supply chains, and help foreign governments
                            build their capacity to end modern slavery in their
                            countries. This App is part of that effort.

                            The first online edition of the App was published in
                            December 2012. In 2017, ILAB adapted it for a mobile
                            application, released in September 2017.

                            This App is for all companies. Companies that have
                            not yet put in place social compliance systems may
                            find it most useful. It can also be useful for
                            companies that have systems in place but are seeking
                            improvement, or those who are working with partners
                            in their global supply chains to establish such
                            programs.

                                eight steps to build or improve a social
                                compliance system
                            </strong>
                            . Each step begins with learning objectives and key
                            terms. Companies that are new to social compliance
                            are encouraged to work through the modules in order.
                            Companies that wish to improve elements of their
                            systems or work with their supply chain partners on
                            their systems can choose which modules best fit
                            their needs. However, they are encouraged to
                            consider implementing all elements of the social
                            compliance system presented here in order to ensure
                            integration of all components and effectiveness of
                            their systems.

                            As companies familiar with social compliance know,
                            this App is just one of many guides, handbooks,
                            white papers and other materials that provide
                            information on social compliance. We hope this App
                            provides useful guidance and examples available to
                            help you build or strengthen your social compliance
                            system or that of your global supply chain partners.

                            Because ILAB&rsquo;s TVPRA mandate is to work with
                            persons who are involved in the production of goods,
                            this App focuses on social compliance programs for
                            companies that produce goods, rather than services.
                            In addition, as noted above, it focuses in
                            particular on issues related to child labor and
                            forced labor.

                    ILAB chose to highlight certain companies&rsquo; practices
                    in this App based on extensive literature review and
                    engagement in social compliance-focused fora. These
                    companies have shown leadership in one or more areas of the
                    App&rsquo;s eight &ldquo;Steps.&rdquo; These examples are
                    illustrative and not exhaustive. Many other companies have
                    also developed, or are developing, good practices in these
                    areas that could also be shared. These examples are also
                    snapshots in time and ILAB recognizes that companies&rsquo;
                    practices may change over time. ILAB welcomes input from the
                    public on additional leadership practices that could be
                    highlighted in the App.{" "}
