                 (“EO List”) is intended to ensure that U.S. federal agencies do not procure goods made by forced or indentured child labor. Under 
                 procurement regulations, federal contractors who supply products on the EO List must certify that they have made a good faith effort 
                 to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to produce the items supplied.

                    from 26 countries. This list is required by&nbsp;
